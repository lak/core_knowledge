Like Rise of Robots, this book is a polemic against automation. It does, periodically, indicate that maybe, once in a while, some piece of technology has actually helped people, but only ever as a lead in to pointing out some other, much worse way in which it has hurt.

The primary flaw in this book is that it really only considers the harms of automation, and never really how it helps. It lambastes the downsides of automated farm equipment, but never mentions the fact that they’re the only way we can feed 7 billion people. It never mentions the benefits of no longer wearing burlap because we have better weaving and sewing tools, or of our ability to stay closely connected to people all over the world because of transportation and computers. So, all it can reasonably do is provide a lot of warnings, but bring your perspective because it has none.

It’s hard to know what to make of this book. It is not as badly written as Rise of Robots, which really just means its strident opinion is a bit more tolerable. It could comfortably have been half as long, which I know because I skipped quite a few pages and was still stultified with the repetition and reiteration.

I think its most damning criticism is, I don’t know why this book exists.

Are we meant to be afraid? Retreat to the woods?

Who is it for? People who make automation? But there’s no advice for them, other than possibly to slit their throats to save mankind.

For users of automation? This book gives no hope to them. They are screwed.

I think it implies there is some faceless power that intentionally creates automation, but if so, no protection is offered here.
