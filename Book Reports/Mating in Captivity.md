# Chapter 1: Safety vs desire
Here we are presented with the high level concept of the book — the question of whether long term relationships can stay sexually fulfilling — plus some of the dynamics in each.

It also presents the theory that sexual desire requires space, but safety in a relationship tends to remove space by increasing intimacy. It supposes that the exact forces that make a relationship stable in the long term also reduce sexuality. “We orchestrate boredom.” I expect this describes many relationships, and certainly ours.

I feel like I’ve tried many times to institute some sort of change in pattern — date nights, going out on weekends, any number of things. But I feel a kind of resistance to all of it that I can’t quite describe, but also can’t defend against.

It’s certainly the case that I’ve stopped doing anything that might put the relationship at risk, which makes it not so much a less interesting relationship as a less interesting life. Given I’m so boring now, I can’t imagine it’s easy to find me interesting or desirable.

This is certainly a topic about a lot more than sex. I feel completely walled off at home: I know that none of my ideas will work, so I often find myself stuck in the middle of a featureless room, waiting for permission to act, for clarity on what would be acceptable.

It would be interesting and worthwhile to explore the eras of our relationship (the eras of our Eros? 😁) through this lens. I expect it’s always been somewhat of a struggle, but during the Puppet years especially I just gave up everything except work and family.

# Chapter 2: Intimacy vs Sexuality
This chapter proposes that intimacy is generally the enemy of sexuality, not its friend. The closer you are to someone all the time, the more you know about them, the less you tend to desire them. There’s no wonder, no place left to wonder, hope, or fear.

I’m not sure I have much commentary on the theory. It passes mental muster for me; that is, I believe it, but I don’t know how much explanatory power it has. What percent of marital bedroom ills would it cover? No idea. Many, but undoubtedly not all.

It does seem to cover some part of our relationship, though. Even before I stopped working, we had little space. At least, little to ourselves; mine was consumed by work and home, hers by home. Neither of us has hobbies to speak of, and while we each have a friend or two, we don’t actually see them very often. I feel like each time I have tried to create space she has rebuffed me. Maybe the problem is I tried to create space for her — “I’ll take the kids for a bike ride” — rather than for myself?

It’s hard to say to what extent more distance could improve our desire for each other. I mean, I don’t have a desire problem, only she seems to. And it’s not like that is new. 

So, I would say that this is a worthwhile topic, but not that it explains everything for us.

At the least, there is history to understand better. I’ve always been dominant and in charge sexually, but not excessively so, and we’ve never talked about any of it. It’s just been kind of understood. Certainly we have never had any verbal aspect to our sexual relationship, and I don’t really know why. Maybe all that’s changed is my own comfort?

I know I’ve been less able to bring her to orgasm, but I also know I literally can’t tell any more. She’s lost her willingness to expose that to me. We’ve talked about this a little bit — the last time I read this book, in fact — but it hasn’t helped at all. She is pretty matter of fact about just not being willing to let me see her enjoy herself.

# Chapter 3: The Pitfalls of Modern Intimacy
Here we study the difference between the intimacy of words and the intimacy of bodies.

This chapter spoke to me, but also did not feel useful, because I don’t feel the ability to gain intimacy in either area. I can’t get her to speak to me, nor can I get her to share with me physically. Conversely, I feel safe sharing both, although I’m not good at it physically.

The shortness of my commentary here likely speaks to its importance in our relationship, rather than its irrelevance.

# Chapter 4: Democracy vs Hot Sex
This is the chapter that really hit home for me. None of the stories matched us, but the discussion overall struck a violent resonance.

A huge part of our overall relationship is how submissive she is, and how dominant I am, yet how uncomfortable I am with that dynamic. I actually don’t think it shows up as much in the bedroom, but that’s probably part of what makes sex such an important part of our relationship: It’s the only place where I feel free to take charge, where I have no double take or sense that I’m failing to be modern or that I have to constrain myself, to make room for her.

Mixed in with that is the feeling that, now that she either rarely or never seems to enjoy sex, I’m actually failing to keep my end of the bargain. It’s one thing to be in charge, yet another to be selfish. Control can be one sided, but pleasure cannot.

This brings up the whole communication aspect. I can’t escape the feeling that she’s perversely hunting down and eliminating any mechanism by which I might understand what she’s feeling. And the few she can’t eliminate, like her emotional reaction to something, she instead demands I ignore.

I don’t feel any desire for S&M, or even dominance games. They titillate, and might be fun or whatever, but I don’t have some kind of deep unfulfilled need here. Yet even given that, this is a huge part of our overall relationship dynamic. If anything, I’d go so far as to say it cripples our relationship, but healthy sex did an ok of healing it. Without a healthy sex life, the core failure spreads.

Hmm.

# Chapter 5: The Protestant work ethic takes on the degradation of desire
This chapter speaks directly to me and how I think about the world, which makes it especially challenging.

It presents the idea of sexual issues as a problem to be solved, and then dashes that as a solution. Of course, some problems clearly are tactical, or require better time management, but a lack of desire generally cannot be project managed away.

It absolutely captures how I’ve often thought of this, and also explains why I’ve never really taken this tactical approach. Partially, of course, I find it abhorrent because that’s what my day already looks like, I don’t want my night to be so structured and logical, too.

Mostly this chapter is about removing options, rather than fixing them: You might be tempted to solve your problem this way. But don’t.

I like the story it has of one partner inadvertently learning how stultified the other partner feels, and how it initially repels him but eventually deeply attracts him.

# Chapter 6: Sex is dirty, save it for someone you love
(Writing all of this a week or two after reading it, so recall is less good.)

This chapter is mostly about how hard society (at least, ours) works to repress sexual urges, or even just sexual desire, such that it begins to seem incompatible with normal life. As you build a strong family, and you have different kinds of intimacy, it’s very hard to retain sexual intimacy.

Yes, partially it’s about distance, but it’s mostly about accepting the health of sex, and that you deserve it. 

“For you, family is about self-sacrifice, not enjoyment. But a healthy sense of entitlement is a prerequisite for erotic intimacy.”

I don’t think Cindy and I have a lot of crazy desires that are just unfulfilled, but given our near complete lack of ability to talk about sex, it’s clear that it’s repressed pretty successfully for both of us. She in particular seems to have worked quite hard to ensure that any enjoyment on her part is invisible to me, which speaks to something, at least.

# Chapter 7: Erotic Blueprints: Tell me how you were loved, and I’ll tell you how you make love
Here we learn how our own sexual desires, and sexual lives, are influenced by how we were raised, and especially by our relationship to our parents.

I’m not sure how relevant this is to us. I honestly have no idea how Cindy thinks about her relationship to her parents, or theirs to each other. I think she feels loved, but I also think it’s very internal, especially from her dad, who matters a *lot* to her, far more than mine does to me.

I know I’m highly influenced by the fact that my parents would have done better if they were gender-swapped. Their relationship, and thus us kids, were hugely influenced by how opinionated my mom was, and how conscious she was of the chains on her. That shows up hugely in my relationship to Cindy — I keep trying to liberate her in the way my mom wanted to be, but she doesn’t feel the chains the same.

In the bedroom, I know that I feel free to be in charge without having to ask awkward questions, or try to figure out if she wants liberation, wants to run things.

I’m not sure if it was this chapter or later ones, but one of these really helped me realize that one of the reasons sex is so important to me is because it’s the only place in our relationship where I don’t have to question whether it’s ok to be in charge. There are obviously other issues in our sex life, but the dominant issue for me in our relationship kind of melts away here.

In some ways this chapter made me feel pretty ok about myself: I can’t really tell if I’m making her happy, and I’m assuming I never am, but I keep trying, and keep talking, and at least sometimes let myself feel free to just enjoy myself without forcing it to be about her.

# Chapter 8: Parenthood: When Three Threatens Two
This chapter is obvious: Kids make an already complicated situation basically impossible.

This is definitely a big problem for us, but it’s probably the most visible one. She just doesn’t have the time, the energy, the feeling of freedom.

I think it’s actually a much bigger problem for overall relationship health than it is for sex specifically.

We haven’t been able to schedule regular date nights, I can’t get her to value them as highly as I do, and there just seems to be a high barrier to doing stuff just us, one I don’t really understand.

In reading this chapter, it at least became clear to me that for this kind of thing, I can take on ownership of stuff like the babysitter: I take on the burden of providing space, so it’s one less job she has. I have historically just viewed it as something she was better at, more practiced, but I think that was a mistake.

I think beyond that, we probably need to be better at talking about where the line is. I think she’s relaxed a lot — too far, really — in what she’ll accept, but it still weighs on her. She isn’t freed by a messier house, just freed of the time it would take to clean it. 

This is one of those places where she talks about confronting a woman about her willingness to give up sex, which I do think is a critical conversation to have. I don’t understand why I seem to be the only person concerned about this. However, it started long before we had kids.

# Chapter 9: Of Flesh and Fantasy: In the sanctuary of the erotic mind, we find a direct route to pleasure
This chapter is all about the role of fantasy in a sexual relationship. Not necessarily about sharing it, or experiencing it; just that it exists, it’s important, and it can have a positive impact.

Our sexual relationship is sufficiently quiet, and I would say to an extent repressed, that I have no idea what hers are. I expect she feels similarly about me. I don’t know what turns her on. The couple of times I have obviously done so have mystified me. (And, of course, I don’t know if those were related to fantasy or what.)

I know for me it’s a lot of “complete the experience”. I don’t just want to camp, or hike, or travel; I want to be sexual and erotic in all of those places. Doing those things, with my wife, but not having some kind of sexual encounter there makes it only half the experience it could be. It’s almost like a bucket list: I want to have done all of the things, in all of the ways, even if they didn’t work.

I have no idea if we should or could ever act out our fantasies — how could I, without knowing them? — but I do think it would be great if we could get to the point of sharing them.

This chapter also reminded me of the active/passive dynamic in our relationship, which is fraught during the day, and important but less fraught at night.

# Chapter 10: The Shadow of the Third: Rethinking Fidelity
Here we ask ourselves how important fidelity really should be in a relationship, and whether it deserves the giant boolean it has.

For me, at least, I don’t think this is a problem. I don’t struggle with fidelity; I just struggle in the relationship.

I assume Cindy has at least wondered if I’ve wandered; I travel enough, for long enough, and to the same places often enough, that she would be crazy not to. But she’s never expressed any of it, and I’m sufficiently transparent that I expect she knows she would figure it out pretty quickly if I tried. We both know I suck at lying, and tend not to even want to try.

I also think both she and I are sufficiently stuck in our traditional ways (at least on this front) that neither of us could realistically consider some other option. That doesn’t mean a lack of fidelity would and should automatically destroy our relationship, just that I don’t think we’re likely to consider a different long-term answer.

So, I thought this chapter was mind-bending, but not as relevant as essentially every other one.

# Chapter 11: Putting the X back in Sex: Bringing the Erotic back home
I think a lot of this is about the value of being able to objectify the person that you love.

I don’t think this is anything like our biggest problem, but it’s worth at least considering at times. I think it’s less about the ability to feel lust in the bedroom, as opposed to just love, and more about the ability to feel free to objectify during the day. I certainly don’t feel safe pinching her, grabbing her sexually, etc. I feel like I’m allowed to be sexy when we’re having sex, but it’s not allowed the rest of the time. I’m sure part of that is because doing so makes me then want sex, which would generally be awkward, not ok.

I didn’t think about it when reading, but the right to objectify outside the bedroom is probably one of the big things that I desire but feels transgressive. Like I’m allowed to love her tits when having sex, but not when making dinner. 

This chapter also talks about spontaneity, which is definitely something I struggle with. I’m somehow 100% convinced that every single time must be spontaneous, that planning sex would absolutely destroy it. Obviously that’s not true, and I know in many cases, knowledge that it is going to happen absolutely heightens things for me. But somehow it sticks, I can’t seem to let it go.

It also discusses erotic play. I don’t know how much this matters. We’ve tended to escalate quickly, so I have largely discounted this, but, well, it’s been twenty years. Who knows now?
