- I am ok sequencing things, but not scheduling them. An order, not a schedule (from [[Agency]])
- My drive:
    - reduce entropy and increase order
    - Cross up Non Zero, ever increasing entropy, lower energy states == less entropy, and my own drive
    - I can't tolerate knowing a way to lower the energy state and not doing it.
- Related to my [[Learning edge]]
