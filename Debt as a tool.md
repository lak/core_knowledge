- I have not been considering the role of debt in a free market corporation.
- If the founder is the central bank, then a new idea goes to get debt from that bank.  A decision still needs to be made somewhere about who deserves money for what, but this model is successful today as a kind of free market; we just need a bank that has completely different loan criteria than current banks.
- This implies we need, at the least, a banker and a regulator.
- The founder ends up being the regulator — they define the values of the corporation, what’s right and wrong, what we’re trying to do, and they interpret laws.
- The banker controls the money supply.
- But don’t they have to be closely aligned, then, to meet the goals of the corporation? That is, money should be provided to people who are doing things the way the company wants.
- Hmm. What does “want” mean? In a market, that implies there’s demand somewhere.
- In the overall market, demand is customer demand, but inside a corporation, demand is different, right? How is demand, ah, supplied? What creates it?
- Is that why you can’t have a free market corporation — the lack of a clear definition of demand?
