	- In [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) and [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Data structure"), a **hash tree** or **Merkle tree** is a [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure) "Tree (data structure)") in which every [leaf node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_node "Leaf node") is labelled with the [cryptographic hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function "Cryptographic hash function")of a data block, and every non-leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes. Hash trees allow efficient and secure verification of the contents of large [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure). Hash trees are a generalization of [hash lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_list) and [hash chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_chain "Logarithm").
