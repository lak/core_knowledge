- Coffee: $20/m
- Lunch: $50/m
- Dinner: $120/m
- But how do I actually tier the product?
- The obvious choice is number of contacts, but... that kinda sucks. If I have a big network I've not done well at using, then I need the product but won't get much value in the beginning. I think the reason it sucks right away is just I get told immediately, because of who I am, that I need to pay more.
- Still, it's the obvious thing. 
- We could also do feature-based pricing. $50/m gets you unlimited contacts, $120m unlocks some level of features.
- We could start with $20 and $50, with the lower tier being ~1000 or fewer.
