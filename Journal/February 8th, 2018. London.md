# February 8th, 2018. London
I feel great.

I don’t want to leave this coffee shop.

Why?

Obviously part of it is the light. The sunlight. It’s just perfect. Cold outside, warm in here, and bright enough but not bright.

I feel optionality but not pressure.

I don’t know if it’s London. I expect it’s a blip that happens to be happening in London.

It’s fair to say I haven’t felt this happy, or at least this particular brand of happy, since the Great Wall, or reading at the bar in Austin.

I twinge at the thought that maybe that’s because I’m alone, that at least this brand of happiness requires solitude. And probably unattachment.

At least part of it is that it requires a general lack of speaking, a lack of needing to speak. It’s been a pleasure to wait until I wanted to eat, to order with few words, to answer questions with gestures not phrases.

It’s partially the open space I can look out on.

The feeling I have not yet spent the day, and that maybe if I sit here, refusing to let a responsibility be pushed into my hand, it will remain unspent.

Certainly it’s at least partially a relief to be back in a place I understand, but is still foreign, still requires some level of code switching, thus giving me the choice, the option.

Well, kind of. No one thinks I have the codes down, but also no one is confused or upset. There’s no stutter step.

But I don’t think this feeling is a response to relieved confusion.

Honestly, it’s a relief not to play that game right now. It consumed too much of my brain, my drive.

Can I recreate it without capturing it? Do I need to understand it, and seek it out more? Or do I just hope for its return, knowing it will be once a year?

What prevents my feeling like this at home?

Home is a feeling of time spending, rather than time unspent. A feeling of not being in charge of my time, of owning my choices.

But one one else owns them, either. I have not been denied. I just have not known what I wanted, or found a way to get it.

Not giving into the desire to play on devices is a bigger role than I would have expected. Just not having access to the internet on my ipad made breakfast much better.

Maybe it’s just that I have a thing to work on? I have to sink to invest my time in, something to dive toward rather than shrink from.

But notably, that thing I’m excited about is tech, is opportunity created by tech.

The VC thing exhausted me. The amount of work I’d need to do to make that work, and the amount of it that I would hate, is just daunting.
