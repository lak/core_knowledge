# What I Did When I Became Free of Fear
From the day I brought someone into Puppet until just before I left, I was consumed by the fear of losing my job. Every investment and a large portion of my hiring decisions rotated around this decision.

For a brief period of time, between when I decided to hire a successor and my last day on the job, I lost that fear. I was a completely different person.

I am easy to fire. It might be more fair to say that it's generally been easier to fire me than to keep me. I had seven jobs in the two and a half years around the end of college, and I was fired from most of those. It wasn't that I didn't do good work (although that was sometimes the case); it was that my work wasn't usually worth the cost of having me around.

I think I was sometimes toxic, but mostly I was just not housebroken. I didn't know what other people needed, and I didn't really care that much. I didn't know how to behave in polite company, and I needed to get kicked to the curb a bunch of times to make me realize it.

Eventually, I leveled up my skills enough (and found positions that better fit me) that people were willing to invest in me to keep me around, and I also learned just enough decent behavior that I had some say in the matter. I never lost that sense of walking the edge, though.

Right about that time, I joined a startup that had a founder a lot like me: Too young, too inexperienced, too brash, and not enough of a team player. He was ignominiously fired by a board who didn't trust him, and replaced with a corporate droid who was everything I despised in both a person and a leader. No, I'll never again work at a company with an exec board room that requires permission to enter. Once I learned more about the startup world, and met more people trusted by investors, I realized how unlikely it was that I could find someone who could partner with me, who could trust me. It didn't help that the first person to offer me a term sheet did with the condition that I let someone else step in as CEO.

My pseudo-cofounders didn't help. They joined more than three years after I started the company, and one of them almost immediately demanded the CEO role, and began claiming to the other that they didn't need me at the company. Months into the job and already trying to oust me. Even then, I didn't feel free fire someone who was working so hard to undermine me.

In fact one of the reasons I didn't raise money in the first four years of the company is because I couldn't find an investor I thought would invest in me, who would trust me to run the company.

Puneet of True Ventures gave me that confidence he was invested in Puppet. Initially, I still focused on having enough stock that I couldn't be fired, and I was very careful about who I brought on to the board or into the company. I came within inches of hiring a president, but backed away mostly because I knew he fit the profile of CEO much more than I did, and hiring him was likely to lead to my ouster.

The point is, I was afraid. I had good reasons to be afraid, and I knew I was afraid.  What I didn't realize was how much it was affecting how I ran the company.

My fear meant I was not free. I cannot know what would have happened had I been. Particularly, I cannot know if we would have done better or worse, faster or slower. I can only know how becoming free changed me, and gave me the perspective to revisit my actions from the past and see how they were affected by my fetters.

I am fighting off tears as I write this.

A great example of how my newfound freedom made me a better leader is designing a new branding system. I distinctly remember a decision-point that required I trust the expert I hired, or my own opinion. This wasn't a new situation for me, although the impact was on the high end. What was new was the freshness that I brought to resolving it. For the first time, I was comfortable not just being the decision-maker, but doing so when literally no one else in the room agreed with me. It's not just that I didn't need the expert's permission; I didn't need anyone's.

As a result, for the first time since I was operating alone, I made decisions I believed in wholly that would have a massive impact on the company. It feels good that in retrospect I'm proud of those decisions, but I'm really not even sure that matters. They could have been busts and it wouldn't have mattered much to me. I made them freely.

This freedom helped me realize how much my decision-making relied on buy-in, relied on my getting the permission of the people around me. If I couldn't convince you, then, well, maybe we shouldn't do it. This is exact opposite of leadership, and the opposite of how I've always talked and thought of myself.

When people bought in, we could do great work. But when people were skeptical, or said yes but then did nothing, I was powerless. It took me years to push someone out who never joined up, who never saw things my way.

Looking back, I see the accumulations of passive rejection that were necessary before I would finally push someone out who was willing to work for me but not with me, someone who would accept my paychecks but would not join up for my goals or my strategy.

One gleaming axe hanging over my head throughout my tenure was a board member's concern that maybe I couldn't handle strong leaders working for me. My fear put every management conflict into that frame, which meant I could not get rid of people who didn't buy in until even the board saw they were failing, and the more of an impact their intransigence had, the harder they were to remove. By their time of exit, they had hurt us too much.

I also saw that my goals and strategy were fundamentally compromised by fear. I am deeply disappointed in the Puppet that I built. I tried every year to change it, to be more user-oriented, less big-deal oriented, less about sales. I continually failed, and I could never see why. I don't mean to say I have a simple explanation now, but one of the big drivers was my perceived need to always hit the numbers. If I don't hit the numbers, I take a walk, so I can't risk that by firing a salesperson who performs but not how I want, or fire a head of marketing who makes his targets but doesn't seem to be concerned about what the targets mean.

That fear-driven push for growth led me to hire in the wrong way, grow in the wrong way, and crucially, raise far more money than we should have and sell far more of my company than I should have needed to. Patience and confidence might have allowed some sideways movement early on to get things right, but fear kept me on the rails.

This newfound freedom caused me to realize how badly my hiring had skewed to people I thought I should be hiring, and how important it was to hire people not just who could do the work, but who wanted to do my work, to build my vision. It caused me to realize how much of my willingness to compromise was driven by fear of the consequences if I didn't, rather than pragmatism or honest compromise to make progress.

I didn't suddenly become a perfect leader or manager. I was still too slow to fire and too slow to hire. I didn't do well enough at articulating what I wanted and why, which made it hard for people to buy in, and when the communications I did make missed their target, I kept moving instead of fixing the message.

But the freedom changed me. I was suddenly dramatically better at seeing in interviews who was buying into me and how I work, rather than just the success they thought they could achieve. I defined the roles I wanted and knew what kinds of compromise were benign and which were lethal. I built a complete new product strategy, forced teams onto the new areas, and laid hard deadlines for what people were going to do and when, regardless of whether they agreed or understood. Their alignment would have been a huge asset, but sometimes it could only come after the did they work, because only I could see the outcome. For the first time as a leader, that was ok to me.

This sense of freedom let me take a big risk on a COO, hiring someone who I knew was aligned in many areas, and who I thought I could manage and mentor in the other areas. When those other areas became critical impediments to his success, that same freedom gave me license to work on coaching him to success or out of the company.

In the greatest irony of my life, that freedom from fear got me fired.

The conflict with my COO was deadly to our relationship, and the board chose the devil they didn't know over the one they did.

I am a better person, a better leader, for my time as a fearless CEO. I think I did better work, and I believe Puppet will greatly benefit from much of what I did in that brief time. I made mistakes, but I have no regrets about the decisions made while unconstrained. I think I only improved, and without would have only done worse. I look back, and I am proud of having been fearless.

I enjoyed it more than anything else I've done as a leader. In that freedom, I could sense a path to being the CEO I really wanted to be. I could feel the early formation of true leadership skills, of strengths and abilities that can only lie fallow when you are not free.

My only regret from that time is that it did not last longer.
