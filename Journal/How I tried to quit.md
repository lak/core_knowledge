The glamour of being a successful startup founder and CEO is hard to fight.  The world is impressed by my company's successes, and wants me to take credit for it, to be validated, supported, and fulfilled by it.  Yet while I can't imagine that my experience is shared by all, I am continually shocked at how miserable my job is.

Whether it's having to fire your college roommate, losing a customer you spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to acquire and retain and whose presence gets you that crucial distance and validity, or, well, missing the birth of your children because your plane just couldn't fly fast enough, it's far more often painful than pleasant.

I've done this for ten years.  Well, not "managing 360 people with tens of millions in sales" this, but "CEO of this company" this.  I've gone through multiple burnout cycles.  I've built fantastic relationships, and then watched them crash and burn on the cold hard reality of what it takes to wake up every single morning focused on keeping the promises I've made to my employees, customers, and investors (pointedly in that order).

With all that, though, last fall was the hardest it's ever been.  Even worse, what made it hard was completely out of my control.  No, that's wrong.  What made it hard it specifically is that such an important issue was totally out of my control.  (Yes, I might have a control issue.)

In the fall of 2014, Max Schireson resigned as CEO of MongoDB to spend more time with his family.  In the course of doing so, he wrote a letter decrying our industry, and the role of CEO especially, for pulling people away from their families, and really, from the commitments they've made to their families.  Many lauded Max's decision to step back, but there was an interesting backlash asking, what about the next CEO?  What about the rest of the management team?  What about the rest of the company?  What about the whole damn industry? If your goal was to change the balance, how did resigning help drive that change?  It's obvious how resigning helped Max spend more time with his family, but it is not at all clear that doing so helped anyone else.  In fact, it's more likely that his resignation resulted in the rest of the team spending *less* time with their family, because that life balance was clearly such a priority for him, and likely wasn't so much for the incoming CEO.

I took the latter position on this topic, but I never discussed it.  My job as a leader is to set an example, to draw the lines, and if I spend time with my family then my team knows they can too.  If I say the only way to spend time with my family is to resign, well, that's a strong statement.  It's a strong statement I disagree with.  No, we don't have a perfect balance, but we know how to talk about it, and when my kids sit on (no, not at) my feet on Fridays during our All Hands, no one's confused about what I care about.

The completely insane thing about Max's resignation is that it occurred during literal race riots in our country.  In August 2014, right around the time Max resigned, unarmed Michael Brown was shot dead in the street by a white police officer.  In fact, nationally, our police officers shoot an unarmed African American dead about every 28 hours.  The discussion, explosion, conversation, fight about this held me rapt during the fall of 2014.  My team took turns lauding and yelling at me for talking about and amplifying this issue on the twitters.

It might be that I was queued by reading Ta-Nehisi Coates's The Case for Reparations.  It might be that my move from a very lefty athiest commune into a god-fearing middle America had me piqued for a fight.  It might be that I live in a redlined district, in a state that outlawed non-whites until 1929 and forbade them to buy houses or start businesses in most areas until the 1960s.  Personally, I think it was the contrast between my ability to set an example as CEO by spending time with my kids, and my utter inability to make any difference in the extent to which African Americans are a complete underclass in our country (and have been since we decided that the Irish couldn't be slaves but they could).

Whatever it was, I crashed.

My job was already too much.  I spent all my time barely keeping my nose -- forget my whole head -- above water.  I fought the good fight.  I cared about employees, I kept my promises to customers, I made sure we had fantastic investors, I built a place people wanted to be.  I worked hard to increase diversity.  That particular quarter I spent a ton of time trying to improve our ability to help women succeed at the company, even though I recognized that even a minor variation from the average ratio of women in technology would be a triumph.

This event made it clear how hard the fight really was.  We had almost no participation by my country's entrenched underclass, I had no plan for fixing it, and no plan I could make had a snowball's chance in hell of changing the system that resulted in the status quo.

Three months later, for -- I assume -- completely unrelated reasons, I decided I couldn't do it any more.  I decided that my company needed a seasoned CEO, someone with different skills, a higher level of callousness, and a total lack of needing me to make any promises.

It's always the promises.

I started my company because I needed software that allowed me to make promises.  Well, that's not quite true.  It's easy to make promises.  I needed software that allowed me to keep my promises.  When keeping promises is your genesis story, it's tough to walk away from your commitments.

At the end of 2014, I wanted to make promises so big I knew I couldn't keep them.  I wanted to promise to African Americans that my country was less racially biased than South Africa under Aparthied.  I wanted to promise we would hire African Americans in key roles throughout the company.  I wanted to promise we would overcome the entrenched racial bias in our country.

But I knew I couldn't.  I knew it.  And it crushed me.  So I quit.

Or rather, I tried to.

It's always the promises.

I told some key board members before the holidays that I had decided we needed a new CEO.  I laid out my reasons -- trust me, they were good reasons, and they had nothing to do with race, or burnout, or gender -- and while they argued, they could also see that I was spent.  I unplugged as usual between Xmas and New Years, entirely comfortable with my decision.  I came back, and delivered to those board members the final decision and a plan for enacting it.  I hired a recruiter. Over a tearful lunch, I told my assistant.  I told my exec team.  I do not think they liked my decision.

I thought I would be able to walk away.  No - I thought I would be forced to walk away.  Our company was prepared to go public in less than a year, we were growing quickly, in a great space, with a great team, great investors, great customers, and all the other excellent, awesome badges you see advertised on the 101.  My belief was that a fantastic new CEO would walk in, put me on a pedestal, and ask me politely not to touch anything.

It's just not that easy.

People want to know why.  I had a lot of Why's. We actually do need skills I don't have, and don't want to have.  I actually was focused on mastering product skills.  They were very good Why's, very believable. And nearly entirely true.

The truth is, it was too steep of a hill to climb.  It might be that my dent isn't as interesting as your dent, but I have spent ten years trying to put a dent in the universe, and here I am admitting that there's a much more important dent that I have to act like is irrelevant.  I couldn't do it, and I didn't know how to deal with it, or even talk about it.

In the cold, hard light of day, with great CEO candidates pushing me on why I wanted to step down, I had to admit: Because I don't think other people will care as much as I do about how our society, and my company, treats its people.  I think other people will look past our society's failures and let us succeed, even though it's mostly male, mostly white, and mostly making already rich people even richer.

As I write this, I think about all the help I could get from therapists helping me feel more comfortable with the system, and my role in it.  So much help.

I wish I could tell you I'm fighting the good fight.  I wish I could tell you that my company will eliminate the pay gap between women and men, will end discrimination against LGBTQ people, will finally make African Americans equal to whites in our country.  I can't.

But I can grasp that my caring and failing is so much better than quitting to be replaced by someone who doesn't care.

So it's once more into the breach, once more trying to change an entrenched system, once more tilting at windmills.  Once more failing, and layering the scars of those failures onto so many.

Better to believe and fail, then never to believe at all.
