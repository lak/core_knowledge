First time.

It’s not that I have nothing to say.

I am just struggling to say it.

I can tell: I have absorbed the truth of “Several Short Sentences”, but not yet become good at using it. I am intensely conscious of my own writing. I have not figured out how to expose a voice through it.

On a positive note, I can tell that when on the other side, my voice will be far more authentic. My writing in the past has been more academic. High quality, but a completely different voice than how I speak.

Of course, my speaking voice is at best layered, and at worst inauthentic. There is a way I would like to be, can be, and then there’s how I actually am in most circumstances.

Why do I hold back? Why am I so funny, so engaging, so complete sometimes, but rarely?

I consider it rude to be the center of attention.

Why?

I do not want to overwhelm people. I don’t want to swamp them. Make them uncomfortable. 

But I am sacrificing a lot.

Do I need to be this sensitive?

What would happen if I no longer did this?

It’s not like I hang out that much with people.

I don’t need anyone’s approval. Mostly.

I don’t have any employees.

And I don’t want any employees that aren’t up for this.

Do I?

Would more fully exposing this voice make me more discriminatory? Exclude people who were not comfortable expressing power?

Would it cost more of me?

What would I be like if I felt the need to always act this way? Would it be as exhausting as public speaking? Would I feel like a failure?

What would I do if I were not afraid?

What am I afraid of?

I’m afraid of overwhelming people. Of being excluded because I am too much. Of fitting in even worse.

But that’s bullshit.

I don’t fit in. I will not fit in. I am fooling no one.

The cost of holding back is now much higher than its value.
