# What do I care enough about to write about?
There are plenty of things I could write about.

Some of them actually mean something to me. Power tools. Business models around them.

But there seems to be little overlap between my biggest concerns and the stuff I write about.

There is also a big gap between what I advise other founders on, and what I write about. Of course, it’s hard to give advice in the abstract. But I don't think that’s all of it.

The topics I feel strongly about aren’t necessarily the ones that matter, or come up in real life. So I’m off in a corner ranting about something, and meanwhile I have opinions and ideas that can actually make a difference to people.

I’ve tried this a little, writing about open source. But it’s not really succeeded. And that’s a relatively small portion of the audience.

What do I advise founders on?
- Founder psyche
- Burnout
- Customer segmentation
- Unit economics
- Marketing funnels
- Golden motion
- Seeing multiple lenses
- Owning their decisions, not letting me or others tell them what to do

What am I thinking about but not writing about?
- Is it too hard to build a business in this monopoly-run world?
- Am I bound to build companies I can’t run?
- How different will privacy expectations be in a decade?
- How differently will people think about owning their data in a decade?
- How much day to day work is really moving to mobile/iPad, vs browser?
- How much does a desktop app vs web app matter?
- How scalable is it to sell to humans instead of businesses?
- How much should I want to grow big vs sell early?
- How much should I want to grow big vs stay small and focused?
- How big can my revenue get with a small team? Can I have high impact with a small team? Do I *need* a big team?
- What’s the right way to onboard my kind of user?
