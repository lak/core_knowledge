It’s not about deleting info, it’s about confidence. How sure are you that this info is still correct?

It’s like the tools that 1Password gives you to help you understand if passwords are good, or should be changed.

The tool should be able to tell you things like:
* When you last used this piece of info
* Based on this, how confident you should be it’s still correct
* Whether this data fits a pattern that should suggest one way or another
