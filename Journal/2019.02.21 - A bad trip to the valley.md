Obviously a lot of the funk is being fired as an advisor from Gitlab. It sucks to be fired, but especially to be fired from the most successful of the companies I advise.

The only upside is, I don’t really get along with Sid. I’m not sure I even like him. It would be lucrative, and valuable in other ways, to be on his board, but wow, I would really struggle in so many ways. I’d have envy. I’d be bored. I’d have no idea how to handle him.

The Sensu board meeting was also a struggle. There were times where it was good. But mostly, it was some combination of horrifying and stultifying. It was an experience that made me ask, can I ever be on another board again?

That’s a crappy enough question that it points to a really bad situation. Yuck.

There was some good work done in the room, especially at the end, but it sucks to share a board with Dharmesh, and sucks to witness this Silicon Valley bullshit situation. Dharmesh asks no questions. He only makes declarative statements. He frames things, and then demands you respond to his frame, rather than asking questions, to help improve his understanding.
