I now have answers to some of the questions I asked.

I do not, suddenly, start working late into the night. My schedule is far more determined by my family than my drinking patterns. That does not mean I should drink every night, and certainly not be drunk, but I must recognize the anchors around which my schedule revolves.

It was no magical cure to my body. I look and feel about the same. I’ve lost a few pounds in just the last month, but lost none for the first five. None. I still sometimes have GI problems, albeit less often. I still get headaches, although far, far less often.

I do not need alcohol. I just spent six hours at an event and was entertaining, engaging, smiling, funny. I was authenticly so. I likely would have enjoyed it more if I were drinking, but I think I would have failed to be moderate, which probably would have pushed me out of the zone I was able to spend the night.

Skipping drinks is sometimes very hard. There are evenings, events, activities where I really want a drink. Sometimes it’s because I want to participate, but most often, it’s because I want the mental relief. The medication. I don’t know if this is a big deal.

I can do it. I can go six months without drinking.

At the end of it, I’m just as mixed on the right long term answer as when I started.

I would like to be able to drink sometimes, but not always. I would like the ability to be moderate, but I do not know if I can ever have that again.

I fear more for my heart. I have had a couple of events over this six months that have made me more, not less afraid. I think I’m at a higher risk there, and that the risks balance out very differently.

I enjoy not getting up every single night to pee at 5am. But I still do it plenty often.

I don’t have the data to support this, but I’m sleeping far, far better. I no longer stay awake from 5am onward. Even if I get up, I nearly always just go right back to sleep.

Non-alcoholic drinks go a long ways to replacing it. A much larger portion than expected is just having something fun to drink. Even just drinking soda and bitters at events like this (the EY event) is miles better than having nothing. Some of it is camouflage. Mostly, it’s just having an option I like.

I get more random headaches than I used to. This might just be because all of my previous headaches had a ready explanation, but it might be that some of the things I drink cause them. Could too many bitters cause it? Am I not hydrated enough?

I am less hydrated than expected. I feel like I drink a lot, and I still need to pee at night, but that pee is yellower than expected. I was apparently getting a lot of my liquid from drinks.

I told people I wasn’t drinking, and it was fine. I only did so after ordering, which I think helped a little. I just don’t care.

It is nice always being able to drive.

It’s wonderful having Kombucha at the soccer games.
