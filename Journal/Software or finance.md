# Software or finance?
There’s a bit of a war for me internally over whether I should be focused on starting another software company, or should be comfortable and excited about the idea of using finance to start many other companies.

I don’t have anything to prove, as Kenny drew out, so I don’t need to start a company to show anyone else. But I do think you can do more with software than you can with finance, so it seems likely that creation is a better avenue than finding people to fund, or even just finding spaces to invest in.

However, I’m deeply hesitant to make another ten year commitment to a company. I gave up a lot of opportunity to focus on Puppet, and I don’t want to have to stick with this kind of monogamy again.

But why not? Is the problem the monogamy, or is the problem that I got bored at Puppet?

No, I really do think it’s the single-minded focus on a single space. I’m too interested and educated in too many spaces to be thinking only of one of them.

No matter how powerful, interesting, and compelling a single space is, it ends up feeling small if you have to spend all of your time in it.

Could I become an old-school inventor, someone who creates things but then starts a company to monetize the ideas? Is that reasonable in a world of software? Why don’t other entrepreneurs succeed at that?

It seems like there’s a real difference between old-school inventions, which required a lot of work to get to initial success, and then most work after that was iterative.

Or is it different? Couldn’t we view software this way? What if we viewed software as a process of invention up to the point of product/market fit, then a process of iteration from there? Yes you’d leave money on the table in some sense, but… How many great products became greater after the initial invention?

Is there such a thing as a science inventor?
