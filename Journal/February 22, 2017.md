I’m a week or so into thinking seriously about this idea of starting a company that creates small but profitable companies. Parts are becoming more defensible, but some parts are a bit more under threat. It’s clear that most people don’t really understand what Berkshire Hathaway does, in terms of using cash flow to fund further acquisitions. This is both good and bad; good, because it means others are unlikely to be doing it, but bad because that makes it innovation, which at least needs to be intentional and is also a decent source of risk. I keep checking, and it seems like mentally I’m committed to this, but there’s not actually a “this” there yet, so I’m not sure that means anything.

We’re also deep into this van thing. I’m obviously more excited by the gadget aspect than I am by the tour aspect, at least in terms of what’s able to hold my attention. It’s not all bad, because using the gear is what’s fun, not just buying it, and we’re doing enough that we’ll definitely be using it.

Regardless of what’s next, I need to get some liquidity. I can’t keep operating like I have it, when I really don’t, and we’re further and further from my having a material impact. If I got liquidity, that gives us time to figure out what to do, time to manifest it happening; but without it, I need to land somewhere before too long. Yuck. The thought of working for someone else at this point is basically anathema. Yuck.

It’s been fascinating experimenting with voice. I realizing I’m failing to write my own journal in any kind of voice. Have I intentionally developed, either of my own volition or through the influence of others, such a dry and intellectual writing style, one so divorced from how I talk? Have I been channeling the “fun” or challenging parts of my communications style into writing, since I know I can’t get away with in speaking?

That’s an interesting thread. If there’s some merit to that, it implies at least two things: There’s risk that my development of a more coherent writing voice results in the same dissatisfaction as my speaking does, and I should likely need to be careful to product writing that actually fulfills me.

Can writing that is not intellectual, not challenging fulfill me? Do I have to choose between enjoying it and succeeding at it? Cannot I get enjoyment from its success, rather than just its method? Must it be florid to be fun?

Conversely, must it be flat to be successful? Is there a middle ground, where what pleasure I have is not a compromise of its effectiveness? Most people are at least somewhat used to reading with less than 100% comprehension, and require only that the message get across. Heck, from what I’ve seen people love coming away confused, even, but that fails at the core goal of informing.  My Gödel talk is a perfect example of this.

Is this even where I should be seeking to derive satisfaction?

That is, am I failing because I’m deriving satisfaction from the wrong thing (insufficiently direct language), or because I have not found a better place from which to derive it?

I know one of my issues is that I want to once again do deep work. This actually implies I’m setting up my writing incorrectly - that I should be spending fewer, longer blocks of time. But the point is, I want to go deep. What if depth were sufficient? When programming, for all that my intuitive form of programming was all about abstraction, deep models, and metaprogramming, I came to really enjoy finding the simplicity in a system, and finding a way to express it directly. Can’t I do that with writing?

On a related note, I keep thinking about TDD for writers. I love this idea of being able to declare in parallel what the goals of a piece of code are, and then to objectively test whether I’ve accomplished them. Human language is more squishy, in that I can’t write tests that can be run automatically, but couldn’t I come to express similar goals? Couldn’t I set up, for each piece, an expressed set of tests, and then ask reviewers to apply them?

Similarly, I could set user tests. Hmm. Is there a difference between the tests I ask of my reviewers and of my users? I mean, I’m assuming my reviewers are “special” in some way - better readers, better writers, in the industry, etc. Do I care what they think? Can I ask more of them? Should they get access to the tests?

At the least, it’s obvious I should be spending at least as much time thinking about the purpose of a piece, and its audience, as I do about the content of the piece. Who can say whether a piece is accomplishing its goals if I haven’t stated them? Who can be surprised when my pieces are wandering and fail to clearly pass a message, when I get 3/4 of the way through before I realize what the message actually is?

In a presentation, we had the Triangle of Tone. I never really succeeded with this, except in so much as it forced me to think about the different players in a presentation. With writing, I think there’s an opportunity to step away from that framework, while committing to the idea of a framework. I think it’s critical to pick a voice, I think it’s critical to have key messages, and I think one must know one’s audience. Shouldn’t some articles have different tests than others? Some are tactical, some are thought technologies, some are entertaining, some are basically fables.

Ok. Every piece should have at a minimum these:

* Voice: One assumes that over time a writer develops multiple
* Key message: the primary thing I expect the reader to take away
* Goal: What I expect the reader to do as a result of absorbing the message
* Audience: Who I think would read the message (which might have little overlap with the implied audience of the message; e.g., lots of non-founders read advice for founders)

Each of these as tests associated with it. That is, they’re useful tools for the writer to keep in mind, but they’re also useful to have reviewers and readers test against.

There are probably some basic unit tests you could do to any piece:

* Strong intro
* Strong exit
* Concrete examples

I could see some testing for tactical advice, or some for changing an opinion, depending on the actual goals.

Do I care, when writing a piece, if it’s part of a larger narrative? Should I be testing for that? Should it affect my approach? Should readers generally care?

Hmm.
