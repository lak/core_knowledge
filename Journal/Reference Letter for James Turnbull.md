# Reference Letter for James Turnbull
To whom it may concern:

I am the founder and former CEO of Puppet, which I ran for twelve years, raising over $87m in capital and hiring almost 500 people around the world. In my capacity as CEO, I got to know James first as a member of the Puppet community, and eventually as a colleague. He worked for me at Puppet for many years, taking on critical roles inside and outside the company. Even after leaving Puppet, he remained an important advisor on many topics in our industry.

In all my years of knowing James, he has exhibited exemplary behavior, both professionally and personally. Because of our connections online, I have been able to see the large number and variety of people who also respect and trust James, from his management to friendship to book writing to event running.

I have trusted James with large budgets and big problems, and I would not hesitate to do so again. I believe any organization would be lucky to have James (and Ruth) as members, and I heartily recommend him.
