# Letter to Scott
Thank you.

I appreciate your telling me that you’re angry, and why.

You don’t owe me anything, so feel free to ignore this email or whatever. But I owe you enough and respect you enough that I figured I’d at least write something.

I guarantee you that I never blamed you for Puppet not doing well. I know that because I never blamed anyone, and I have also always given you a ton of credit, both publicly and in my own head. All of us could have done better after a certain point, but I’m more at fault than anyone when things started to not go well.

You’re right that I wasn’t in a great place for a while, but that generally translated as hiding information, rather than sharing it. Very little was going right, my talking wasn’t going to help anything, and I honestly didn’t have much idea of what, exactly, went wrong.

I can’t be responsible for how people interpret my words. I tend to be far more literal than people expect, as you know, so people add their own subtext. But I would never have blamed you for Puppet’s fortunes. I could see Brian or Bill saying something like that, because I see their role very differently today than I did at the time. But even that’s my fault for not handling them better, or for hiring them in the first place.

I would also never describe Puppet as a failure. I’m not comfortable calling it a success yet, but it’s very far from a failure.

As to stock, I don’t have much to say. I largely stand by the idea that it was my responsibility as founder to help many people get liquidity, especially those who were not as able to do it themselves. While I don’t remember being angry, it would not surprise me. I’m sure I would wish something different in retrospect, but I barely remember the actual conversation so can’t really speak to the specifics.

Thanks again, and I’m sorry for being disrespectful in not remembering that conversation and thus asking for your help.

Regards,
Luke
