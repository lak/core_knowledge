# Still troubled about the future

I woke up this morning from a dream of selling off Puppet, except even in the dream it wasn't realistic -- it was just discussed as a possibility, not something that seemed remotely likely.

I'm a month from returning and have no real ideas on what to do next. If anything, I feel further from having an answer than I did when I started. I'm surprised by how little I'm thinking about the future, but I suppose that's the point. I think in my head I figured I'd spend my downtime thinking, but that's not really how it's worked out in practice. Or maybe it has, and that's why I feel so far from doing anything.

I don't think I have the appetite to start another software company right now. I'm not sure if I ever will, but the injuries from Puppet are too fresh, and the fear of failure is too high, to realistically consider it right now. Of course, that's just another way of saying I don't have an idea worth making this much of a bet on.

Two months is a really long time. We're a month in, it seems like we've already been on the road forever, and yet we're barely halfway through. That seems inconceivable to me. I keep thinking, oh, there's just a bit left. No, there's as much left as we've experienced. There's a lot left. It's a bit frightening.

Now that I'm coming close to accepting it, though, it's also freeing. There is a lot of work we could have done in the first month and was starting to feel not worth it, but now it's obvious that anything we'd consider doing still has a lot of value. Just last night I hung the kid beds via carabiners finally, which means it will be easier to remove and install them every time. There's no reason I could not have done that earlier, and it only took a few extra minutes, but now it's done and we'll get a month's value out of it.

We're falling out of love with the whole camping van idea, I think. Or at least, that's how it sounds. Things like the cabins at Cumberland Falls make it hard to see the value of the van - we stayed in a decent place as conveniently as we could have camped, and far more comfortably. Less expensively, but really, nothing about this van is about price.

The biggest pain I want to wrestle with is the bikes. It's just too difficult to get them in and out, and it sucks. I want my bike out every day, but it's too troublesome. I want the kid bikes out every day, but no way. I don't know where to put all that stuff, but it can't stay where it is.
