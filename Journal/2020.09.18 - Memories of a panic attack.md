# 2020.09.18 - Memories of a panic attack
Watching Ted Lasso (the episode where they beat Everton):

He has a panic attack. The kids clearly don’t understand what that is.

I pause the TV, and go to explain it.

In the course, I am reminded — and describe to them — a recent panic attack. Why? It was Friday, I think. Something work related. And reminded me of Fridays at Puppet, of how hard the work was. Of how bad Fridays were. It was a lot of pressure.

I’m clearly still much more traumatized from it than I would have expected.

Even remembering those Fridays made me panic again.

We finished the episode. But when done, I slowly collapsed. I found myself unable to help clean up the kitchen. I was struggling to breathe. At real risk of another panic attack. Raised heart.

I retreated to the basement because that’s where my iPad was. But I could not sit. I needed to be reclined. Stretched out.

Panic sucks.

I don’t know how I put myself through it. I wanted to say I don’t know why, but I do. I felt it was necessary.

I’m so, so much happier working remote.

I can’t imagine my Puppet life if I had not had to be so much in person.
