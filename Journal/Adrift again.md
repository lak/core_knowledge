# Adrift again
As I set the target of getting better at writing, and as I began actually producing work, I thought I had a path, almost a plan.

Now, I see a long road of boring leadership pieces ahead of me. I see many advisory roles, board memberships, and something bland around finance, always on the sidelines but not doing. I have become less enamored of my product/company ideas, not more, so I have pulled away from everything but nothing has filled the space.

This group session around CEO transition trudges. I no longer need to be healed, need a cushion, but it constrains me from authentically trying to be one. The people running it are the dumbest in the group, and slow all of us down to their level. I am hateful.

The van is all-consuming, but not productive. I have let it become a sufficient reason for existence, without it actually being anything like a full time job, or even something I can realistically move forward on.

For reasons I don’t entirely understand, my relationship with Cindy is at a low ebb, worse than it’s been in ages.

I fear for Puppet. Mostly, really, I fear for my money, my assets. I don’t think it has a good path in front of it, and I don’t think there’s much I can do about it. Yuck.

I like to help people. I really like the idea of spending a lot time doing so. 

I still don’t really like the idea of primarily being an investor.

I can’t figure out what I think about being an operator again.

I am liking my freedom. 

I am disliking the feeling of not accomplishing something, not having a hill to climb.

I have no goals. I have no targets. I have no plans.

I gave myself permission to not commit until the fall, but I thought I’d have stronger pulls by now, that something would want me enough that I would feel somehow proximate.

The possibility of a book has maybe frightened me. If I don’t write it, then I’m acknowledging my topics are all small. If I do write it, then I am setting myself up for the possibility of miserable failure.

There are topics I can’t stretch into words. I can’t compress them small enough to fit, but can’t pull them far enough apart to be a coherent complete story.

Why would I write a book?

Why am I writing at all?

When I think of the book, I think of fame. Plaudits. But I don’t actually care about those things.

I believe I have special insight, and it could help others, help them do more, do it faster, and almost more importantly, do it with less pain.

Am I extracting that insight for me? For them? For a platform?

How much time am I willing to spend on it? How many years? Am I willing to do it on my own? Do I want or need an editor? What am I willing to give up to do it?

If I’m serious about this finance thing, shouldn’t I be working on that? Shouldn’t I be actively investing? Shouldn’t I be doing something?

If I wrote a book, where would it be? Strategy or founders, right?

Maybe it’s one book, not two. Maybe it’s one narrative.

What is it?

**Went for a walk**

There is no obvious narrative at this point. The best stories are stories, but mine is incomplete.

The topic can be the startup mindset, the founder mindset, etc, but those all get to the wrong thing.

What is it that I believe, what is the core that I defend against all?
