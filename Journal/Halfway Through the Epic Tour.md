# Halfway Through the Epic Tour

I've spent a lot of time asking myself existential questions about why I'm on this trip and what my expectations were. I'm disappointed, but I'm not sure I have a right to be. I'm obviously not doing all the stuff I thought I would be, but it's also not really clear why. Some of it is because of family limitations, but a lot of it is because I just didn't do the work necessary to make it happen. And really, Cindy pushed pretty hard on the idea that I only missed a couple of real opportunities to do much.

So it's more that when I think about my expectations, I thought much more about activities than where I slept. I don't really care if I "camp" - I care if I hike, if I ride, if I get out there and see great things. Camping and seeing nothing is worthless, where staying in a lodge but seeing great things is totally worth it.

Linville Falls was almost entirely disappointing as a result. We did the little hike to see the falls, and we drove to Boone. We could have done more, but just didn't. Of course, if I hadn't rolled my ankle I could have pushed for something, but it's obvious that wasn't going to happen once I was injured.

That's the other big cloud hanging over me: I'm injured, now in three different ways (back, ankle, and ribs). I have probably cracked at least one rib. It really hurts, whenever I do anything involving the right side of my chest, which turns out to be, ah, pretty much all the time. At least ribs can't turn into a repetitive injury... right?

On a different note: I seem to have lost steam on the pictures and writing. Part of it is that it's hard to compare with what we saw in the west, and also that it's hard to write about the family stuff vs just the parks. But I'm sure there's more than that. I think there's a reason I write in the mornings, not in the evenings: I don't want to work when I'm done for the day, I want to relax. And these things are chores, they're real work. And also, honestly, I'm often too drunk and too tired to do the work. I wasn't drinking any less in the west but was still able to write, but really, I only built a couple of posts over a couple of weeks. I'm not too different now.

The pictures are harder now. They need to be taken and managed specially, rather than my being able to pull them out of the roll. Right? Or could I be talking about the van and just throw in a bunch of pics from the trip? Couldn't I?  Hmm.
