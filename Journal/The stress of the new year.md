# The stress of the new year
I’m afraid of committing to something.

I’m also afraid that I’m a fraud, that I’ve spent all this time on stuff that’s not for white tech guys, and I’m going to go ahead and build stuff for white tech guys.

That being said, some things are true:

* “Given I’m going to write today, what is the one other thing I have to get done?”
* I’m in no danger of being committed to too much, so I need to start laying some stakes down
* I’m very interested in the “app platform built on a content addressable file system”
* Most of my real interest and work lies instead with the “doing work in the real world” genre
* Either of them would be better than doing nothing
