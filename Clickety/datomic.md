This is the detailed scope of work for migrating from PostgreSQL as our primary transactional database to Datomic.

- [x] Pitch: https://github.com/clicketycorp/documents/pull/344
**the work**
 - [x] incorporate datomic schema support into clickety-services application
 - [x] incorporate clojure.spec schema support into clickety-services application
 - [x] test-drive datomic user creation via tx-data / transaction functions in datomic ions
 - [x] enable CI for datomic code paths
     - [x] prep test suite for datomic CI
     - [x] create s3 bucket for private maven uploads (datomic.ions, datomic-dev-local)
     - [x] create bin/ script to run datomic CI
     - [x] use maven s3 repo for dev-local deps when appropriate
     - [x] create GitHub Actions workflow to run datomic CI (uses dev-local and s3 private maven repository)
     - [x] configure datomic CI to not block GitHub PR merges
 - [x] add datomic connection into context via pedestal interceptor for use by API resolvers / mutators
 - [ ] remove all deprecated schema endpoints / types / etc. (coordinate with Sandy)
 - [x] infrastructure
     - [x] destroy jpp infrastructure (currently paused)
     - [x] delete jpp pg instance 
     - [x] code to import production postgres to production datomic (note: we can delete and re-create datomic databases easily)
 - [x] write to datomic on interaction ingestion - https://github.com/clicketycorp/clickety-services/pull/493
     - [x] create interaction subtype data for a given interaction
     - [x] create interaction (non-subtype) data for a given interaction
     - [x] create handles and people
     - [x] ensure we rename people as we get better information
     - [x] create interaction-handles
     - [x] wire this into our normal email ingestion flow
     - [x] write to datomic on calendar ingestion
 - [x] feature flag users in postgres to read from datomic
 - [x] add function to check read feature flag and return datomic reads in resolvers
 - [ ] bring jpp code for API read queries (*ByGid) to clickety-services system
 - [x] implement self query
