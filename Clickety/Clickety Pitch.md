# Clickety Pitch
- “No one has built a personal CRM company”
- Literally everyone wants this product. Everyone. You want it. Everyone on your team wants it. Every founder you know wants it.
- But no one has built it.
- Oh, I know you think people have. But they haven’t.
	- Rapportive never tried to make money
	- Gist sold early
	- Contactually and all the rest built address book apps
	- Accompany was focused on public data, not your work history
- No one has actually done the relatively obvious bit:
	- Take what we’ve learned from sales and marketing tools, and make it available to everyone
	- Then add no-code automation and api-driven sharing
	- And make it work for every job


- Scope to leadership, then expand to everything
- The problem is the job of leadership
	- What problems?
	- Leaders need to professionalize, like sales has in the last two decades
		- Turn from “I know people and can convince them” to an entire discipline
		- It is nearly impossible to hire for that expertise
	- The job of being a leader sucks
		- Constant context switching, with no tools to help capture and replay
		- You succeed or fail at least as much based on natural talent for faces, names, and context as actual leadership skill
	- Organizations suffer because they select for natural talent rather than learned expertise
		- Every org performs worse, has higher employee churn, and lower satisfaction because of this


CRM for every job
Here are six roles each with a use case
It's a pillar in the office suite, as pervasive as excel and as relied on by some people
Here's what we've built
Here's what's next
Here's what we're raising
Here's the team
Thanks

Problem: There’s no single source of truth for the people in your life and the work you do with them
- Every person and problem is written down in a different place, or not at all
- Many critical problems have no tools to help with them
- No automation means everything takes too long, and most doesn’t get done
- Sharing is manual and expensive
- Suffering and failure for too many people

We Believe
- People matter more than any other type of work or information
- A tool to help with people and the work you do with them can and should exist
- Tools can be the difference between an average leader and a great one
- Every information worker will own a version of our product
- We will succeed by making accessible the key capabilities that sales and marketing have to rely on

Leadership will go through the same size transition as sales has in the last two decades
- Professionalize leadership by reducing the advantage of natural talent in knowing faces, names, and context
- Everyone will be able to automate the way sales and marketing expects to today
- Sharing of and querying about people data will happen via API rather than email
- People tools will address the entire market, from niche to verticals to power users to low-demand users

[25 million meetings a day][1]
[21.4 million managers in the US][2]
[Managers spend 35% of their time in meetings][3]
Ergo, managers spend 14.98 *billion* hours in meetings a year
