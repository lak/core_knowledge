- We finished the Alpha0 / Atomo release today. Well, mostly.
    - Major last features were Group Activity Feed and Comments. Comments don't *quite* seem to be working.
    - Aviel is an outside user. I'm eager to get his feedback.
- At today's work review, I went through my [[Product Board]] for the first time.
    - It was useful, I think.
    - The [[Deca Release]] seems pleasantly small. There are a couple of larger, risk-factor features, like Contacts, but overall it's impressively approachable.
- I spent a lot of time on the phone this week. Lots of calls, full days. It was a tiring week.
