## Please describe your relevant or unique skills, knowledge and lived experience as well as any volunteer, work and educational experience that would help the Charter Commission fulfill its work. (No more than 250 words)

I’m the founder and former CEO of Puppet, one of Portland’s largest software companies. That role gave me a unique perspective on Portland’s variety: I had employees who walked to work, rode religiously, took the bus or train, or drove every day. One aspect of running my business was managing their varied interests and needs, both in how they got to work, and what they needed while there. I also gained and demonstrated skills as a leader within my company and the wider Portland startup and tech ecosystem.

In my business travels, I have also gotten the privilege of comparing Portland to other great cities, from San Francisco to London to Barcelona to Beijing. My love of Portland was kindled by comparing it to my home town of Nashville, and wondering why two ostensibly similar cities have ended up so different. Over time I studied urban growth and design, and the interplay of policy and citizen action. Portland fighting back against the Mt Hood freeway is a perfect example of this complex dynamic.

I’ve also learned to recognize the roles of race and power in government systems. We successfully fought a freeway through the white neighborhood, but failed to do so through Albina, the heart of Portland’s Black community. While I can’t bring the perspective of a Black person to this commission, I recognize the importance of representation by all of our citizens, not just those in the majority.

## Please describe your experience working in community, diverse groups, or public bodies, and provide examples in which you contributed to productive group processes and collective work in a collaborative, multicultural and/or multilingual setting. (No more than 250 words)

Puppet was built around a community, which I helped engender and support. We have a worldwide community of users and developers. I have traveled to and spoken in tens of countries. I’ve arranged events in many countries, in many languages, and learned how to ensure they’re successful for the people in the room, not the event designers in Portland.

I have participated in other large technology communities. I’ve helped organize and run large events for a general community. I played a significant role in the DevOps community, which has had a world-wide impact, starting with events I supported in Ghent, Belgium.

I have also served in what ways I can as a technology and business advisor to local and regional governmental leaders.

## Please describe: 

a) your experience addressing issues affecting people with disabilities and/or age-friendly initiatives

and/or 

b) how would you insure that the voices of people with disabilities are included in the conversation at the Charter Commission

(No more than 250 words)

My experience supporting people with disabilities largely comes from the software world. At Puppet, it was critical that our core products include everyone. We had to remove barriers for people with different vision characteristics, like color blindness. It was critical to consider how anyone might use our product, not just those we talked to most often. Everything we built, from products to documentation to tools had to keep this wide variety of needs in mind.

While not a disability, we had to practice similar discipline during localization and internationalization. Portlanders speak many languages. This has just as big an impact on the work of the commission.

If I am chosen for the commission, my commitment to including the voices of people with disabilities is anchored by the curb cuts on my street corners. These were initially mandated by the Americans with Disabilities act. Yet my toddlers took advantage of them when learning to walk. I used them when injured, relieved at the lack of a jarring step into and out of the road. My wife’s parents use them daily as they age, thankful for easier access to the bus and local shops (and their grandchildren!).

I know that disabled people end up representing the needs of everyone. If we fail to include them, we leave out so many more. If their voices are heard, they bring everyone else with them.

I also know they deserve to be here as much as anyone else, and we should ensure they can.

## c) Please address your commitment to and experience supporting and/or advancing equitable outcomes. Refer to examples from: your school, work, community, places of faith, family, etc (No more than 250 words)

Equity should be a key goal for any city. Ability is evenly distributed, but opportunity is not. The only way to get the most out of what we have is to lift everyone up, to ensure no one is left behind.

Unfortunately, Portland has an all-too-common history of excluding many from its priorities and policies. Its current government structure allows majority perspectives to overwhelm everyone else, as demonstrated by how many council members have come from the small chunk of land between the West hills and the river. And of course, by how unfairly our city’s policies have affected the Black Albina community, and the many minority communities east of 82nd.

One of my main motivations for being involved in this commission is to seek a more representative government, one that will more reliably prioritize equity over the needs of the majority.

At Puppet, I helped found the Tech Diversity Pledge, where leading tech companies committed to increasing diversity in their ranks. I was also a founding member of Project Include, led by Ellen Pao, where CEOs made personal commitments with similar goals. I have mentored, advised, invested in, and supported founders of color and women founders.

I also have the pleasure of practicing equity every day with my identical twin daughters. They can spot slight imbalances from a mile away, and I get constant practice righting them.

## If selected and appointed to serve, what would you hope to accomplish during your service? (No more than 250 words)

My primary goal in joining the commission is to help design a government that allows Portland to be brave. The next fifty years is going to be incredibly challenging, and our government needs to be up to the task.

We should draw out the best and bravest voices in the city. We should center those who most need and see change. Today, we do not. But the commission designing the city charter can help ensure we do.

Modern Portland was founded by citizens fighting back against bad transit policy, Robert Morris’s Mt Hood freeway. That one act led to decades of bravery, making us a complete outlier compared to other American cities: Building light rail. Prioritizing non-car transit. Investing in a great bus system. Supporting and enabling small businesses over chains, and walkable neighborhoods over strip malls.

That desire to lead into a new world is still within Portland.

But the government cannot see it. Does not *need* to see. Our city is structurally *incapable* of being brave. It represents those already at the top of the ladder, those with the most to lose if we change. It ignores those who most need a different world.

Our government has also become dysfunctional. I am a deep believer in the abilities and merit of public servants. I respect them greatly. They deserve leaders who know their departments and understand their work.

I want to help us design a government built to grapple with the problems of the present and the future. One built to get the most out of the amazing people and amazing resources we are lucky enough to have.

## What interests you about the Charter Review Commission? (No more than 250 words)

I am interested in the Charter Review Commission because I think it is a unique opportunity, uniquely timed, to get Portland to rethink itself and its future.

Portland has been a leader. And can be again.

But not without structural change. Not without hearing everyone. Empowering the whole city. Getting the most of Northeast, East Portland, and deep Southeast.

I am also a believer in leadership. I want a government that Portland’s strongest leaders want to join. Instead, today, we have a government that no one wants to be a part of, because it is structurally biased and limited. Too many great people cannot get a majority vote from the whole city, leaving them sitting on the sidelines instead of helping to write our future.

I am interested in the commission because I think it can and should be a first step toward Portland’s next fifty years.

## Please describe your ability to listen and consider other perspectives which may be different from your own. (No more than 250 words)

I designed and built the product at the heart of Puppet’s business. Like all successful founders, I had some good ideas, and I was committed to them.

Puppet would not be where it is if I had not let them go, though. More times than I can count, I told a customer: No, you don’t need that. It works fine. Only to learn, no, they were right, they did need that feature, I was wrong.

I got practice every day listening to people who thought differently, who came from a different background, who had different goals.

As the company grew, I had to manage the needs of hundreds of employees. I learned to prioritize diversity, even though I come from a dominant cultural group. I learned to care about localization, even though I speak only English. I learned to prioritize the needs of marketing and sales, although I know little about how they work or why. I retained my ability to see through the eyes of a beginner, of a new employee, even though I was long in my career.

I have also spent the last five years focused on learning from those unlike myself, both in my community and in the wider groups I participate in. I have built relationships with founders, investors, employees, and community members from far outside my background, so I can see a little bit of the world they live in.

This insight is a big part of why I’m interested in this commission.

## The Charter Commission operates transparently and is a highly visible work group; the work product and meetings will be subject to public meeting laws and accessible to the public. The work of the Commission will draw media attention and advocacy by community groups.

Please describe your level of comfort and willingness to work in this environment. (No more than 250 words)

I am a deep believer in transparency, and have no trouble with visibility.

I ran Puppet so transparently I had to train my employees to handle the amount of information being shared. I trusted them, and they trusted me to operate in the open.

I struggle outside of a transparent environment. I thrive when everyone can know everything. I do not shy away from sharing what happens, why it happened, and what the consequences are.

I also thrive in the public eye. I am not an extrovert, but I enjoy the accountability that comes with living in public. I like the challenge of bringing people on board, not just talking to those already in the room.

## We expect that Commissioners will need to dedicate between 5-12 hours a month to the work of the Commission. That time will be spent in meetings, reviewing meeting materials and supplemental information and collaborating on research if necessary. 

Are you able to commit to this time commitment?

I will have no trouble with this commitment. I am used to balancing different needs, between my day job, my family, community commitments, and personal commitments to other founders and communities. I have the time to spend now, and have a flexible schedule both in work and home.
