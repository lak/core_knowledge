Luke 

Luke Kanies began writing Puppet and founded Puppet Labs Inc. in 2005. As a sysadmin and consultant, he needed something his customers could rely on, that they actually wanted to use. Luke saw that new technologies like cloud and virtualization, and the rapid scaling of IT, meant that companies wanting to compete effectively needed to quickly adopt more agile ways of managing IT, and to regard IT as a core competency and strategic asset.

Ten years on, Luke has raised $87 million in invested capital and grown Puppet Labs to more than 360 employees around the world. Puppet Labs’ software is used by more than 25,000 companies today, including 62 percent of the Fortune 100. Its model for IT management is so integral to modern data centers that the world’s most prominent technology companies are partnering with Puppet Labs: Amazon, Arista Networks, Brocade, Cisco Systems, Cumulus Networks, EMC, Google, Huawei, Microsoft, VMware, and more. Puppet Labs has won numerous industry awards for its software.

Luke is a recognized thought leader in the DevOps movement. His creation of a completely new approach to IT automation has bettered the lives of sysadmins around the world, and helped companies ship software in minutes instead of months, saving them millions and generating millions more in business value. Luke has been invited to speak at technology events around the world such as OSCON, LISA, Linux.Conf.au and FOSS.in. He serves on the boards of the Technology Association of Oregon and MobilePaks, an Oregon software company, has been named as a finalist for the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards, and won the Entrepreneurial Achievement Award from the Oregon Entrepreneurs Network in 2014. 

Luke enjoys acting as an advisor to other technology company founders and entrepreneurs, sharing his experience in open source technology, DevOps, IT evolution, and scaling a business while building a great company culture. When he’s not traveling, Luke commutes to the Puppet Labs headquarters by bike, enjoys inventing new cocktails, and watches Arsenal football games with his wife — who is a scientist — and their identical twin daughters. Luke earned his B.A. in chemistry at Reed College, and the scientific method — starting with a hypothesis, then building, testing, and learning from tight feedback loops — informs his approach to building Puppet and Puppet Labs.

Luke founded Puppet and Puppet Labs in 2005 out of fear and desperation. The tools he found as a sysadmin did not give him the confidence to believe he could promise his employers and clients both stability and the flexibility to make changes quickly and easily. 

Luke set out to create better operations tools, and on a wider level, to create fundamental change in how systems are managed. Today, Puppet Labs has more than 360 people committed to these goals, with more than 24,500 customers around the world using Puppet Labs software, including 62 percent of the Fortune 100.  

Well known for his thought leadership in DevOps and how companies can turn IT into a competitive asset, Luke has spoken around the world at key technology events, including OSCON, LISA, Linux.Conf.au and FOSS.in. Luke has been recognized by a number of organizations as a business and technology leader, and Puppet Labs has won numerous awards and recognitions from a variety of technology and business publications.
