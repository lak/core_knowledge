Admit I’m going to be trying to build a movement around this.

“People use tools every day, but they don’t necessarily think about them.”

“We’re trying to avoid the sin of growth hacking by building tools instead of products. We are at risk of immediately slipping into preciousness.”

The point of tools is to use them. They should be good enough to use, but not so good that you are afraid to.

Consider a series that zooms in on your everyday.

I have not been talking about expertise.

Consider a deep dive on the tools in my life.

I’m pulling a lot of things together, but this is all really tangible in the end.

I need to enroll people in a story, a way of thinking about things.
