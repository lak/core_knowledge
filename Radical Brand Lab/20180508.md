We’re an interesting transition where it’s easier than every to make user-oriented companies, but most of the data, expertise, and success models are around buyer-oriented companies.

I think my greatest source of weirdness is my unwillingness to accept received wisdom. The rest of my weirdness comes from filling in the gaps that this creates.

Write about these topics:
* Having conversations with myself
	* Specifically vs with other people
* “Hey, just checking in to see how much of a dickbag I was last week”
* The perils and spoils of self indulgence (from me)
* Define self indulgence, and ruminate on how it affects you
* “I’m sorry to interrupt you twice”
* “Most humans are worthless”/“Mostly humans are worthless”
* “Hold up. Community is important to you?”
* “I get an allergic response to the idea of talking about myself for myself’s sake”
