# Day 1
Can I write an argument for why a decentralized economy is at least as big as a centralized one?

“Avoid the surveillance economy”

Why don’t I consider it interesting to write about my why? I’m an atheist, but I invented my own why. Why would no one else find it interesting? (This is in response to being asked why I focus on deep learning.)

“Enabling people to feel noble in the work that they do”

## Areas of deep learning
Decentralized systems and owning your own data
