”Why haven’t you written a book?”

Things that would cause me to write a book:
- Offensive gap
- Useful badge
- People will read books not posts

Title to one of my books:
“User hostile” - all about bad design

“If it weren’t for the fucking users and the fucking designers, we’d have way better fucking products.”
