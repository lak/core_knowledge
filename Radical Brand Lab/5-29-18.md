Story-telling day. Productivity, and tightening power tools with my dad.

Seek analogies for: 3 days spent painting the louvre doors, and making a sunflower instead of a clean, sunk nail.

The painting is more about how messy the process is, and tools cleaned it up. The sunflower is about how messy the result is.

These are both examples of waste.

Visualize this. An x/y grid, talk about job transitions. Similar to the important/urgent grid.

Ask my dad: How was I able to convince you to rent the paint sprayer?
