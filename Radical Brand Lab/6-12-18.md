How do I think of tools:

Three ways:
* How it changes the job (shape of the job)
* What new callouses form on the hands (how it interfaces with the human)
* What work it does (how do you make it work)

Many things (e.g. Coffee cup) seem like tools but don’t fit the definition

“Decentralized in nature and centralized in practice”


“The original metapedant”
