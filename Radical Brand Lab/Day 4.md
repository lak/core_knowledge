# Day 4
Irreverent, vulnerable, humble

I am underestimating the impact of my signaling strategy, and growing up in a cult. It’s a very coherent view:

* It’s only worth talking about disagreements
* You signal to find believers
* They convert people
* That drives change

Building tools to help people do the work, rather than just tools they use at work (hammer and sawhorses, vs water cooler and radio; the cell phone is a middle ground, necessary for work today but probably a bug that it’s needed so much)
  
Tools that understand you as a person doing the work are different than those just meant to help you manage the work. (The classic example of the calendar that knows you exist, but also an app that recognizes you have other windows open, and has opinions about them.)
