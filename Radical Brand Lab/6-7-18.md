When does a tool become a product? When a user is confronted with the business model in the course of using it.

Two examples:
* Centralization of data
* Data being held by the app

An application that reserves all of the power in the relationship is less useful, less powerful to me. One that gives me more power, more control, is more useful to me.

Question: Could you build a company that built tools but not products, that did not confront its users with its business model?

Given a definition of tools that is demonstrably different, do we:
* Act like itâ€™s not the case
* Invest in our opinion on the belief it will pay off
* Proselytize our opinion, in hopes of changing the market

This could be a strong preference but not a hard line.
