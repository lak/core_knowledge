Robots are the future you see, but you can’t get there with faceless corporations mandating automation — the only way to get there is by helping people get rid of their worst work, not helping companies get rid of their worst/lowest value people.

When you build automation, are there people in the picture?

Are you automating for some faceless consumer? Or are you automating the actual work someone is doing, right now?
