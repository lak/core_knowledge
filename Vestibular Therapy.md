# Grounding Practice
Sit in a chair with feet flat on the floor, head touching the wall behind you. Press your feet into the floor, your back, shoulders and head into the wall behind you. This will increase the amount of sensory information your brain gets regarding body position. This is helpful in a crowded restaurant and in the car.

Close your eyes and count backwards from 100 to 0, by ones, twos, or threes as quickly as you can without pauses. This will distract the mind from focusing on being dizzy.

Open your eyes and assess: Is my dizziness less? If so, continue to use this strategy as often as you need it.

You can perform this exercise standing against a wall

You can also apply pressure down through the top of your head.
