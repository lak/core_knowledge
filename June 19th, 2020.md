- First attempt to use Roam?
- Talked with Wilkes and Rick about [[Local-first in Clickety]] in our 1:1s
    - Long-ish discussion about [[AWS Appsync]] vs [[automerge]] vs building from scratch with [[CRDT]]
    - I should connect at least Wilkes with [[PVH]] at some point. Once weâ€™re far enough along, he could likely do a workshop, and maybe join the community.
- Made no real progress on the [[Clickety launch blog posts]], but made an effort. Switched from focusing on [[Our users are experts]] to [[Use Case: Meeting Management]]
- I could see moving daily pages from Ulysses to this.
- I should probably make a go at porting all of my Journal pages here?
