For [[Deepak Giridaraghopal]], in [Kudoboard](https://www.kudoboard.com/boards/mawXbU7Q/kudos/create):

I've been honored to work with you all these years. More than that: It's been an honest joy. You made the hardest parts worth it, and the sweetest parts better.

Every team member, every customer, every community member has been influenced by your work, your personality, your presence. Everything we've done would be less without you.

Ten years doing anything is amazing. Doing so at a company with Puppet's level of change is stunning.

I'm incredibly proud to have helped drag you out of the misery of a poor developer having to do sysadmin work and into the deeper pain of a poor developer having to be a manager.  😁

Thank you!
