# Letter to Alaska Camper Vans
Hi Charles,

That's great to hear.  Would you be helping on an hourly basis? I just want to make sure we've got a reasonable agreement in place, so neither of us is surprised. I'm also CC'ing my wife Cindy, as she's heavily involved in the design.

This email has become, ah, quite long. I'm happy to talk through this instead of your trying to read it all, but now that I've written it... :)

I'll focus on our goals first: My wife and I will be touring the US park system this summer with our twin 8yo daughters (they turn 9 in August). This van is primarily for that tour, but success with it would be us keeping it long-term and using it for other short (e.g., a weekend at the coast, which we do often) and long (a week or two each season) trips. We're also likely to loan it out to friends pretty often, including a 6 person family with two dogs. If we can get seating together in time, we'll be taking it for a week-long trial run the last week of March, so that our first trip isn't stepping into a 2 month journey.

Our goals for the summer are roughly:

* Spend 2 months traveling, mostly visiting the great parks, but also visiting a couple of friends in nearby cities.

* End the summer being comfortable enough camping that we could pack for it in an afternoon. Today it would probably take at least a week, possibly two, to plan for a few days in the woods, but we fly enough that we could pack for a week-long airplane trip in an afternoon.

* Get some great (but non-technical, mostly) trail-riding in as a family. I, in particular, view bicycles as by far the best way to get around, so I hope to find places where we could turn an afternoon hike of a few miles into an afternoon ride of 3x that.

We expect to mostly camp, but also would like be able to sleep in the vehicle when weather is bad. We'll also periodically stay in hotels, when appropriate.

A big self-imposed constraint is seating. While we will primarily be traveling as a family of 4, we would really like to be able to seat 6 at times. My wife and I don't have a car that seats six, and it comes up relatively often -- for instance, we often head to the coast with my wife's parents, and it would suck not to be able to fit them into this vehicle for those trips. We've also been convinced by another designer of the value of a living room-like experience that results from leaving a lot of space between the bench and the front seats, which is why we're focusing initially on the back row of seats, and plan on adding a removable middle seat bench at some point later.

We've got most of what we need figured out. 

We're starting with a Sprinter 144" 4x4 van that was up-fitted by Outside, to a basic level (interior, insulation, 3 panel bed, stereo, heat, a few other things). We went this way because we're on a short timeline and didn't think we could actually get another solution done in time. Everyone we could work with is months out from being able to accept work, from what we could tell (and even getting the van could take a long time). We're going to end up undoing, or working around, a lot of the work done by Outside, which is frustrating (but only our fault).

The exterior is pretty well decided: We'll be getting an Aluminess rack, mount 1-2 solar panels to it, and add a Fiamma awning to the rack. We're almost definitely going to get an electrical running board, because the van is pretty tough to get into right now. The rack isn't actually required, but if we do solar and an awning and add the rack later, we have to redo all the work, so I figured to add it now and build around it.

The big constraints are in the interior.

Bikes: We have to carry two big adult mountain bikes plus two kid bikes (and one assumes we'll at some point carry 4 adult bikes). I also ride road bikes, so it should support them (mine is 6" longer than my mountain bike), even though I won't be bringing them on this trip (unless we just magically have the space for one, which is highly unlikely). We're focusing on the trays because that allows us to maximize storage around the bikes and also easily mount them front to back. I really like the construction of the trays you made, but I'd like to find a more space efficient form, preferably that enables us to have a small cabinet between or around the bikes. The Traipsing About people have a great example:

Seating: The kids need to be legally seated with shoulder belts, we need to be able to add seating for two more in the future, and the kids shouldn't have to be touching all the time when we're on the road. I.e., a two person bench wouldn't work well, because they'd be shoulder to shoulder, and would fight *constantly*. We thought hard about captain's chairs for them, figuring they'd be more comfortable, but in the end we figured, heck, they're kids, they'll be fine, and it'll be helpful to have the bench seat as another sleeping surface. Plus it's like $5k cheaper (when comparing to Outside, anyway). We could still be convinced to do the individual chairs, but that's where we are now. I'm actually not too thrilled with this solution, but I can't see another one that gets us this level of flexibility.

Sleeping: We're pretty flexible here. We'd *love* to have side flares so that my wife and I could sleep sideways and thus have a shorter front-to-back bed platform, but that involves undoing all the insulation et al in the current van and putting in the flares and re-insulating, which is going to be really expensive no matter who does it. There's a chance we'll have Outside do this before we go, but a lot of other stuff has to line up. As it stands, we'd be sleeping in the 3 panel bed, and we need to find a solution for the kids. If we don't find something better, they can sleep on the bench and the floor. However, my preferred solution at this point is to build some simple, light single-person bunks that I'll hang from the ceiling when we sleep inside. This should be relatively easy to set up (using the L track buttons and rope), we should be able to store them under our mattress on the 3 panel bed, and when they're in place they'd make for a kind of roof above the living room which would be great because my wife and I could sit and read or something while the kids slept. We're also talking about making it possible to hang curtains around the various beds to enable some visual separation when we become too much for each other.

Kitchen: We're getting a 50qt ARB fridge (looks like a cooler), and a portable kitchen (possibly from TrailKitchens.com). We don't plan on cooking in the van, and instead will cook under the awning or outside. We don't have a complete solution here, but whatever we do needs to be portable, and my current plan is to lash it all behind the driver's seat. We're pretty open on where it goes, though. We expect to add a water system, but aren't sure about whether to get heated water or not (this summer shouldn't need it, and we don't know if we'll have power capacity). We don't expect to have a toilet or shower; we can't afford the space they'd take up, and we hear most people don't use theirs.

The van we have is very low on systems, and we're not likely to add many for this trip. We're getting a portable compressor and won't be trying to fix it into the van at this point. The only real additional systems we plan on adding are solar (mostly to power the fridge, plus charging our iDevices) and water (so that it's much easier to carry sufficient water; warm water is a nice to have for now, not required). If the van is a long-term success, I'd expect to invest in more systems over time. If there's a big difference when building cabinets between doing them now and later, we can do them now.

That basically leaves storage. We are most likely going to end up with a bunch of backpacks or something full of clothes, sitting on the bed when we're not using it, and sitting on the floor or in the cab when we are. We don't have a solution here, and it's probably the most uncertain thing. We need gear for camping (tent, bags, etc), all of which we'll strive for double duty when sleeping in the van. I.e., we don't want blankets for the van and bags for tents, and we don't want double mattresses.  We'll have some collapsible chairs and maybe a table or two for sitting outside, and sometimes on the roof (that's my favorite thing about the roof rack).

There are two short, and mostly useless, cabinets above the wheel wells right now, with removable lids. I plan on replacing those with much taller and wider cabinets, probably a lot like are in the van Dino has now.

I'm planning on turning the wall behind the driver's seat, at the very top, into the electrical panel. That's already where the control for the diesel heat is, and it's about the only easily accessible but out of the way place. This is also likely a place where we could put a short cabinet, running all the way to the back door, which would be nice as long as it retained the option to add flares at some point. I assume it would attach with L track, which would mean it's somewhat removable.

We're thinking about making the front seats revolving, but have heard it makes them so tall that my wife might not be able to sit in them. I'd prefer not to have to replace the bases.

We have been considering a table that's a bit like a train table, except hideable: When extended, it sits in front of the bench, and likely unfolds to become wider, but you could fold it to make it narrow, then tilt it up against the driver's-side window and then slide it into a socket (not sure that makes sense; I could explain further if needed). I don't know if this actually works or not, but I just started playing with it today and I like it a bit already.

Mostly, I need help with the storage, to get the most out of the cabinets, and with the drawer. I am now thinking I'll make one full-width drawer rather than two, and have a fixed cabinet (I hope) between or around the bikes. I can't come up with a use for two cabinets instead of one, and I can see plenty of downsides. Or maybe just make the drawer narrower, and a wider cabinet?

If I have the vertical space (which I don't think I do), I'd *love* another, short drawer under the bike drawer, which would be great for storing small stuff, and if both were lockable, I could use it for a poor-man's safe for things like iPads. I've also thought about how to get the most out of the side cabinets under the bed - if that storage space is full, they're going to be hard to get to, even with the bike drawer extended. I have been thinking about all the tricks you can use with cabinets, like rotation, Le Mans cabinets, tall thin drawers, etc. Not sure any of them work, but I'm all about easy access.

I also love how you have put a bunch of attachment points in places like the van doors, at the ends of the cabinets, etc. I've often wondered why no one has put cabinets on the doors themselves - it seems like you should be able to put like a 4-6" deep cabinet, which would give you a lot of incredibly accessible storage but that was also out of the way. We have mesh bags on the doors right now, and they seem mostly useless, especially the pair that are hit by the bed frame.

We're using Pinterest to store ideas (we have separate boards for the van, the kitchen, electrical, and general), and Trello to track the upgrades and their priorities. I'm happy to share any of them with you, if you're comfortable with the tools, but I can also just directly send you the key data. The Pinterest boards are much more idea factories than plans but they give you some sense of our aesthetic and what we've been perusing (although we don't trim much from them, so they don't necessarily reflect our current opinions).

Hopefully you can tell we've thought about this a ton, we're relatively opinionated, but we also are very open to better solutions. In fact, I'd *love* to have any of these ideas replaced with something better. There are problems I'm attached to solving, but I don't think I'm attached to any of the solutions.

What's your preferred path from here?
