# Prompt: Every time I hear...
...that I just need to change, I go through alternating waves of despair and defiance.

I've been aggressively trying to fit in for all of my professional career, by changing both how I appear and how I actually am. I have unquestionably changed more than anyone I've worked with, and have likely changed more than anyone I work with has ever known. No one can or has questioned my commitment to change nor my success at it.

Yet even with a higher rate of change than anyone around, I am still not good enough, not fit enough, not alike enough. Even that, I don't really mind. What I mind is the implication that I somehow am choosing not to get this last mile, that for all my effort maybe I just need to make that last gasp of effort, that last little commitment, and suddenly I'll fit in.

There are two clear and painful problems with this bullshit implication.

The first is that, of course, there's no motivation for me to work this hard but hold back the last little bit of fitting in. It costs me a lot and benefits me nothing, so why would I do it? Occam's razor says I just can't, not that I won't.

The second is that it implies this whole thing is a choice of mine. The mere ability to change so quickly and drastically makes me weird enough I could never fit in, but even without that I could never fit in. My weirdness is as intrinsic to me as my skin color and my height.

You can't go back, you can't undo who you are, you can't unlearn what you've discovered, and you can't close back down a perspective you've acquired.

You can ask much of me, and much I have given. But to think I am petty enough to cause and suffer this much pain out of choice is to think too little of me. It makes my difference stand out more, your lack of insight more apparent. If you lifted your head, you would see. But it's easier to just demand from me, to put it on my head.
