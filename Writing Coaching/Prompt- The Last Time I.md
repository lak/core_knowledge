# Prompt: The Last Time I...
...felt unfettered joy was walking the Great Wall in China.

Some reasons for the joy were obvious, some will likely never reveal themselves.

Unfettered is the right word. A lot of the joy came from the feeling that I was entirely in control. Whether we kept walking, sat for a bit, went back to Beijing; these were all under my control. It was one completely free day where I owed no one, needed nothing, and was doing something beautiful.

I could stand at the edge swapping lenses on my camera until I felt like changing it. No one got impatient, I knew I wasn't burdening anyone. I picked my own path.

I was still CEO of Puppet. I have two daughters, and a wife. Life is complicated. It piles up. Adults rarely get the opportunity to be unencumbered, to be let go of by everything, even if only briefly. I don't curse the bindings, but that doesn't mean I don't celebrate a respite.

I am embarking on a two month tour with my family this summer. I will bring with me many large gravitational bodies, each of which will build its own complicated orbit, and the sum of which will make for a complicated set of interactions over the course of our travels.

Nevertheless, I must find a way to have some time where I can feel completely in control. I don't have to worry about what others want, or how others feel. I do what I want, and they orbit around me, rather than some sort of complicated action and reaction that so often defines family environments.

Bringing the bikes makes this much more likely. Exploring on a bike is one of my favorite activities of all time, and mine should give me more freedom, more control, and more ability to pursue. 

This is important enough we should all negotiate our space for this. Each of us deserves to periodically be the sun around which everyone else orbits.
