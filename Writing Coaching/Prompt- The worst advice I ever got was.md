# Prompt: The worst advice I ever got was...
...brilliant three years later. One thing people don't provide when they give advice is a reasonable idea of how to tell if it might be valuable to you. So much advice is something like, "If you're an entrepreneur you should...", but that label could as easily attach to someone doing a side project on weekends and someone with 500 employees, so it's pretty unlikely to be useful to everyone.

As CEO of Puppet, I had to learn how to assess advice's suitability, not just its usefulness. Doing this was largely prompted by my sticking around long enough: Eventually I found that advice that was utterly worthless years before suddenly had value. The advice hadn't changed; my situation had. Before this switch, I was much more judgemental on advice, deriding it as worthless or finding a way to incorporate it into my life. After, I became better at socking away advice, and tending not to judge that which I found useless. I would often find that it was in fact useful later, either to me or to someone else, and my open-minded recognition of the importance of context became important in how I received and how I gave out advice.

As I progressed as CEO, I particularly enjoyed finding useful tidbits that I already owned but had not found utility for. Spending time in reflection became that much more useful.

This lack of context in advice has dramatically increased my cynicism about the advice industry, though. In general, I don't think it's an accident that most advice sounds like it's useful for everyone, when it obviously isn't. There's a lot of incentive for people to claim a broader audience than they deserve. This large but inappropriate readership then pushes people to dumb down their advice, again in the interests of broadening the context, but in practice it makes tactical but focused advice now generic and bland.

I don't think people do it on purpose, exactly, but they are rewarded for doing badly and never punished for their sins.

I do not think the advice industry requires this, but it sure has enabled it.
