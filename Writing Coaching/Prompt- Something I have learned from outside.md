# Prompt: Something I have learned from outside
Herman Hesse's Steppenwolf has given voice to the perfect analogy for my frequent feelings of other.

Something happens -- some comment is made by someone, some obvious question is asked without thought, I somehow fail to explain something that is so clear to me -- and I feel like an alien, a shadowy wolf stalking lanes filled with placid villagers.

It's not the aggression of the wolf, it's the different instincts, different mentality, different priorities, and different instincts. A steppenwolf is not actually a good analogy, but the book as written provides a perfect one.

When all else fails, when I have hammered home how alone I am in the world, the book reminds me: So are others. It's not so much that I am in the world with a small group, but that many people suffer that same level of otherness, of intrinsically not belonging, of being another species.

It gives me comfort, which gives me confidence. When I am acting out of educated instinct, I am strong, but when I am second guessing, trying to act the villager, my thumbs fail, my tail knocks over fine china, and all of the noises are too loud or too quiet.

I have a weird combination of little self doubt, yet constant second-guessing. When it is in sync, it allows me to make very high quality decisions, but when it is skipping, catching, stuttering, I can barely move.

Being reminded of the steppenwolf, being able to translation my lack of belonging into a model that provides insight, gives a wrapper for the disconnect and allows me to step back into being and doing without so much thinking.
