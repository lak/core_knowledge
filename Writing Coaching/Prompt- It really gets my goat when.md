# Prompt: It really gets my goat when...
...people don't use their brains, they're power to think and analyze.

We all have our biases and our tightly held beliefs, but we also all have the power to think our way past them.

I don't mean that everyone must have deep intellectual curiosity, or must be able to self-analyze. But before you open your mouth, before you make a declarative statement, or even before you ask for help: Think.

One reason I hate this behavior so much is that people assume the same of everyone around them. Nearly everyone time someone talks to me, their statement implicitly starts with, "Given you haven't thought about this and aren't really using your brain..." Thus are we pushed to a lower standard of interaction at all times and in all places. If I indicate how deeply I've considered a topic, I'm being condescending. Somehow I have to pander to the belief of others than I am unthinking, unconscious, unaware. How did we get to this point? Is it solvable?

Our country has developed a deep anti-intellectual bent. We respect force of voice, not reasoning behind it. I recently read that our ability to destroy the value of facts was largely innovated by the tobacco industry, which I find believable. We've now taken that art and turned it into a science.  That's certainly part of it.

It doesn't help that we are a country founded largely by religious extremists, and often, religious isolationists. The Quakers left England because they were prohibited from practicing their religious as strictly as they desired. The Baptists and many other American brands of religious got built on the pulpit, not in the seminary. They thrived by driving emotion past the protections of the intellect, and survive today by rejecting our right to question, equating doubt with sacrilege.

From this heritage, we reserve our right to believe obviously wrong things, and consider it wrong to presume someone else's facts have sway over our reality. One cannot create a legacy that both shuts down dissent and encourages intellectualism, yet America has tried.

Nor, of course, do I think this is a purely American phenomenon. It is merely our culture with which I am most familiar, especially in how it connects our history to our present. Our present time both reminds me of the cost and of the waves of opportunity that periodically arise when the reality becomes too bright to deny. We can do better, and we will. I just hope someday we do well.

The US has great opportunity, but the only way to achieve it is to as a nation, and as individuals, break past our legacy of anti-intellectualism, and our tolerance for non-thought. Civilization is the gradual accumulation of technology, and for a country as powerful as ours to reject the technology of doubt, of discarding faith in favor of knowledge, puts us a on a long walk off a short pier. It guarantees obsolescence, even if it does not put a timeline on it.

We can do better. We must do better.

But it all begins with one step: Think.
