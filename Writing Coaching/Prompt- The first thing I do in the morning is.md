# Prompt: The first thing I do in the morning is...
...wait for my blood to loosen. My veins run with ichor in the mornings, and until it softens into a liquid, I can move but can't really think or talk. 

Simple questions with simple answers can pause me entirely. I can follow directions, but can't make easy decisions about which recipe to cook.

I don't wake up with strong opinions, but given how useless I am, I tend toward a pattern.

On school days, I wake the girls. I swing their door open, and say good morning. I've learned not to wake them harshly, but also not to leave until they each have spoken. I often have to reach into their bunk beds to push a little on them, make them roll over. Their first words of the day are usually some sort of guttural complaint about waking up. They get this from me, so it's hard to be too upset.

I go downstairs. I put my iPad at my spot on the table, so it's ready for me to read. I turn on the stereo in the dining room, start OPB on the computer, and turn on the stereo in the kitchen.

I make coffee. I grind 4 scoops of coffee, just enough beans at just fine enough grind that the brewing basket is always full but does not spill. I read twitter while it grinds. I pour it into the basket, barking the grind catch against the sink to shake the last of the dust loose.

I set out breakfast. This is usually yogurt with granola. I slop the yogurt into a bowl for each of my daughters, but I leave the granola to them so they can stir sugar in first. Plus, that way it doesn't get soggy.

By about this time, people are wandering downstairs, and the coffee is nearly done. I head into the kitchen, set out two cups for coffee. Mine goes on the right, Cindy's on the left. I usually have soy milk, she has cow's milk. I read Twitter until the coffee is done, at which point I bring it to the dining room table, and sit down for my own breakfast.

Yogurt, granola, stir. Read, eat, drink. I finish the bowl about when I finish my first cup. I usually get to pour a second cup and switch from the table to a comfortable chair, where I finish my second cup and do a little more reading.

I help Cindy get the girls ready and off to school. She usually walks them down.

On truly blissful days, the only words I have spoken are those first words to wake Lillian and Vivian.

I brush my teeth.

I've been awake for about two hours.

The day can start now.
