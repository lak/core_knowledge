# Prompt: The best advice I ever got wasn't very good at the time
I'm an infovore who can't stop reading, can't stop absorbing, can't stop seeking a new and better way of working through whatever is in front of me. But I'm also a cynical infovore. Most of what I've read is useless. Most of the talks I've been to taught me little to nothing. Most times I've sought or gotten advice from people were dominated by useless time.

Anything else would be asking too much of those who are trying to teach you. The challenge you must give them is not, "Make all of my time worthwhile". The challenge is, "Provide enough value that I am happy with my investment in time."

If you attend a 3 day event, and it is nearly all wasted, but this one discussion, or one talk, makes you 1% better at your job, how long do you have to work before the literal and opportunity costs of the event are paid off?

To demand that someone inform you is to abdicate your own responsibility in getting better. You must collect, filter, organize, consider, reject, absorb, and integrate. Others are merely the sources of information; you must turn that into insight.

If you have no knowledge of a space, then sure, the first couple of discussions are hugely informative, and you're dangerously close to accepting someone else's input as your own view. It's your responsibility to go past that, though - if a space matters to you, you have to invest in enough diversity of thought that you generate your own perspective, one that is impossible to just accept wholesale from someone else. If you're not interested enough in a space to do that, why are you learning anything about it? You've just offered someone the opportunity to terraform your uneducated and uninterested brain, without having enough knowledge to make a high quality decision about who you hand the plow to.

Most advice is worthless. Most time spent in seeking better answers is wasted. But the seeking cannot stop, cannot be abandoned, without abandoning your search for excellence.
