# Prompt: I always carry in my pocket…
…enough resources that my abilities are basically limitless at any given time. It’s incredibly freeing.

No, I’m not likely to need the ability to buy a new set of clothes, rent a car, buy a plane ticket, bail a friend out of jail, or any such thing on short notice. But the fact that we live in an era where I can walk around every day with the resources for all of that and more is pretty impressive. It’s an important part of keeping perspective.

I travel a lot, and while it’s easy to be paranoid about leaving things behind, it’s important to remember that at least for most of my travel, there’s just no reason to be afraid, because if needed I can pop down anywhere and buy just about exactly what I need on short notice.

I’m not sure I can even conceive of how foreign this concept is to people from even a couple of generations back. My family tends toward hoarding, and I can tell that it’s because we grew up with nothing. You can’t afford to just get rid of stuff if you might not be able to get it back, but when you know regaining ownership is as easy as a credit card swipe, it makes less sense to be emotionally attached to unsentimental objects.

We have our cute little Every Day Carry (EDC) trends today, and yeah, I am a part of it, always carrying a knife, and having a set of practices and opinions that keep me happy and as prepared as I reasonably need to be. But I find it useful, interesting, and humbling to look back and ask myself, what would I have needed to have on me at all times a couple of hundred years ago? What would my opportunities have been?

In a somewhat frightening way, though, that looking back also results in a  torrent of loneliness. Because the reality is that my ancestors survived on their relationships, and what they relied on at any given minute rather than physical resources was the trust of the people around them. Now, that worked out incredibly poorly for anyone who couldn’t build that kind of trust network, or who wasn’t born into one, but for those who had it, it was in many ways more valuable and certainly more fulfilling than the ability to easily replace a pair stained pants.

The freedom that I carry around in my pockets everywhere I go is fantastic, but so much of it is useless because the mere exercise of it permanently breaks bonds that mean a lot to me. Like a removable wedding ring, I am constrained by choice, I fetter myself.

That makes the few opportunities I have to use my resources to help others that much more powerful. How great is it transfer my unusable freedom to someone else?
