If I point out that something clearly is not working, she usually throws her hands up, gives up. Almost never uses words to respond.

It basically means I can’t recognize the situation when something bad is happening. I have to act like it’s normal.

This is especially hard for me. I feel a deep need to call out the truth I see.
