# Joining her work
(Rewriting after seeing notes from Karin conversation.)
She often has a rough plan, a thing she would do if I weren’t involved. I can't figure out how to talk about that plan, how to help her with it. Everything I say seems to indicate to her that I don’t want to do it, or that I want creative freedom, when it’s the opposite: I just want to help, in the way she wants help.

But she seems to have concluded I don’t like plans, or I don’t like her having a plan, so she actively repudiates any idea of one.

I’m confident this one is actually my fault, at least mostly. I am sure I did push back against stuff, and for all I know, still do. I see a clear difference between helping someone on the path they’re on, vs having a plan, but we can’t seem to share those words.

A little thing but one that annoys the shit out of me is just how to assemble dinner. She makes multiple things, and won’t tell me how I should assemble them. She would assemble them in a specific way, and she almost always had a specific idea for how to do so, but she is so concerned about providing me freedom that she won’t tell me anything.

I’ve taken to letting her prepare her food then looking at her plate to figure out how she does it. I can copy her, but I can’t just ask her.

I want to help, but I can't figure out how to.

This is an area we’ve made some progress on. But it’s taken a decade. I had to learn to ask how I could help in very specific ways, or I got told no help was needed. Once I learned to ask “What can I do?”, she would answer.

When I ask for guidance on any of it, she wants to give me freedom, which I assume she thinks I want, but in general, I want to help her, not realize myself.
