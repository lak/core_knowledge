# Choosing a strategy
(Rewriting after reading note from Karin.)

I wrote, in the note from a meeting with Karin, “choosing between her pessimistic strategy and my optimistic one”. This is a doozy.

She is very much a worst-case thinker, and I tend toward, “meh, we’ll figure it out in the moment”. She builds plans, and they’re based on the fear things will go wrong. I don’t build plans, and I figure things will be ok.

Some of it is definitely role playing: She’s taken on (and I’ve abdicated) the role of “the one who ensures we have what we need”.

Some of it is also that she takes any kind of failure very harshly. I can roll with it, and not get too upset, when I did not prepare sufficiently. She takes any lack of preparation as a moral and personal failure, and seems to suffer greatly emotionally.

We’re completely incapable of agreeing on how to approach something. We can’t even have a conversation about it. Even trying to results in the inability to discuss something further. Like the thought of being slightly meta is inconceivable, or more like, incredibly rude.
