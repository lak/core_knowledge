# Expressing what she wants
I cannot get her to express a desire, in almost any situation. Even when I very clearly ask her what she wants, or say very explicitly I want to do what she wants but I don't know what it is.

A couple of times she has believed me when Iâ€™ve said this, and told me. But the majority of the time, doing this ends the conversation.
