- I'm taking a week to myself, for work and personal stuff.
- The goal is to spend the week thinking about stuff that I can't fit into a normal week. This requires few operational meetings, and minimal overall commitments.
- I'm also planning to minimize drinking. I want to go to bed and wake up clear-headed.
- I expect to spend most of the week reading and writing. But I don't know what about yet.
- Questions I am hoping to work on:
    - Who can I learn from? Should I reach out to second-time founders and see if I can find some who can give me advice?
    - What do I need to think about in the next quarter and the next six months? Of this, what am I not yet thinking about? Why not?
    - What is my learning edge? Where am I actively trying to improve my skillset?
    - What kind of help do I need? In what form?
- Things I might consider:
    - A first draft of a skill tree
    - A product view of how we'll implement that
- Tactical work I could undertake
    - Get all product management docs in place
        - E.g., move all strategic ideas out of the product_planning repo and into the the [[Clickety Planning Process]]
        - Ensure all the docs in the document repo are up to date
    - A test app for sending data to Clickety
