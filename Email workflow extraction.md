- There are multiple huge businesses being built just from extracting specific problems from spreadsheets. E.g., before Carta, cap tables were just in spreadsheets. Now it’s a multi-billion dollar business. This is a whole trend now.
- Maybe there is a similar practice available to us: Find workflows people use in email, and build them into our product. Examples:
    - Double-opt-in intro: Jill emails me asking for an intro to Jose. I forward that email (or ask for modifications) to Jose, asking if he’s ok. If he says yes, I email both of them intro’ing them.
    - Who can make an intro? I email ten friends, asking if they can make an intro to a given person. Each of them replies yes or no (or ignores the email). I pick one, and ask for an intro.
- What is the chance there are two and only two?
- How much of this is about email explicitly, vs communication workflows in general?
- How much of our value could be encapsulated in this, vs building out general functionality?
- Clearly related to [[Reducing the role of the inbox]].
