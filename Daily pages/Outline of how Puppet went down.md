# Outline of how Puppet went down
Our easy successes put us on the wrong path, and we didn’t have the bravery to shift tracks until too late.

Failures are generally ignored, only successes matter. This cuts both ways: You can generally ignore the failures and double down on your successes, but sometimes the failures matter more than the successes.

The early stage of your business largely determines how your company will operate for its entire lifetime. I.e., the successes that happen then will reverberate forever, and the failures, will generally be ignored except as they contribute to finding the right successes.

Thus, the failures you let drop will be totally irrelevant, and the successes you let survive will be your legacy.

The big mistake I made at Puppet was being unwilling to sacrifice our early successes to fix the critical failures. Nearly everything that I cared about was doing poorly (engineering was bad, product was worse, marketing was just missing, etc.), but hey, sales were doing well (albeit not in the way I wanted them to), so we kept pushing on. We never took the time to fix the things that mattered, and by the time we had to, it was too late.

I had a head of sales who was great at bringing in dollars, but who wasn’t too fussed about how it was done, nor too concerned about how it aligned with the long-term goals of the company. As a result, our sales model got slower and more expensive while our product got more complicated. 

This worked. We doubled annually for more than 5 years, so it’s impossible to say we weren’t succeeding. In some ways he was correct, in that he followed what the customers wanted, but this also meant we were doing what others wanted, rather than what we wanted. However, the longer we doubled, the more it hurt that we hadn’t fixed the big issues. Eventually, we hired a head of engineering who declared, “We have no strategy.” I took offense at this, but listened, because anything else is madness.

I spent a long time learning about strategy, thinking about what it meant to have one vs not, and eventually I basically concluded, I had a strategy, but the company didn’t.  Rather, while I had a somewhat coherent strategy in my head, I had never expressed it to the team, nor had I managed to align the team with it.

Feck. This is failing to capture what I was hoping to.
