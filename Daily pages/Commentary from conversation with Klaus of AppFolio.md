# Commentary from conversation with Klaus of AppFolio

I'm less convinced that founders are so important.

There have to be forms of software that are more invention-like, more capable of encapsulation and handing off to others.

I know that right now I am just not spiritually up to committing to another company, but of course part of the problem is there's no company I'm up to committing to. Maybe some new thing will take me and I will need to build it.

But that implies a kind of relationship to Puppet that never existed. I didn't start Puppet because it couldn't let me go. I started it because a startup in that space was the best decision for me at the time.

Then, I was seeking to change trajectories, change identities.

Now... Now, I have opportunities I never had then. I don't really need to change something, instead I have to spend my freedom wisely.

I did not have fun running Puppet. I had fun when it was just me, but not otherwise.

What would a fun-optimized life look like?

I know it wouldn't just be travel. I love travel. But it's not enough for me.

I love outdoor activities, and I would like to do more. But that's not enough.

I think I need to feel like whatever I'm working on, I have the chance to be the best in the world at. I need to compete.

I also (think I) need to feel like I'm accomplishing something, and that whatever I'm accomplishing is the highest-leverage thing I can do. It's not enough to be busy, or to win, or to enjoy myself. I do feel like I have to put a dent in the universe.

I just don't know what kind of dent.
