I woke up to this message from Rick, after mentioning to him yesterday the idea of visiting Nashville, possibly as early as this week:

I guess my main question is around the specific/particular intent.

It is straightforward to say that lack of in-person time causes drift and that getting in person helps with that drift, but that's not getting to the root of the urgency I don't think.

There's a world in which "we now realize we're at risk of engineer turnover, how do we mitigate the cost to the company if that happens?" (answers: reaching out to other engineers, making the best use of extended runway, getting runbooks in place soon, getting the system to its stablest place, focusing on front-end/mobile/etc. uses of platform functionality, etc.) is a driver, though I believe that can be done remotely.

The issue(s) that I raised last week, which I've been gradually raising for a few months now, seem to me to distill down to: you seem to need to have an intense level of control over so much of what happens in the organization (at many levels), and I, when I hear your stories and think back, see this as a thing that has probably gone on for a long time, and has been the cause of much pain for you and others over the years. I find myself running into this and I find it exacts a toll in energy/emotional drain, and I find it hard to have the space to work, and find myself mentally tallying whether my role has a future. If this is something that can happen to folks, if it appears to have been going on for a long time, if I find myself being one of those folks, I'm not interested in perpetuating that indefinitely into the future. The best thing I can do, I believe, is to find various ways to point out what I see, to get the company and its product in the best place I can, and then find a way to move on.

So, ironically, if the intent of traveling is "I'm scared of what's happening, I need to exert control over this situation, and I'm going to fly in and do that" then it's actually precisely the wrong thing to do, from my perspective, if the core issue seems to be one of being weary of the over-extension of control.

If the intent is one around "I need to talk with someone about the things I'm feeling because of the issues arising" then I'm sympathetic, and I'm interested in being helpful, but I didn't sign up to be a therapist/guru/chaplain/etc., and I know you have access to some very skilled folks whose talents and job descriptions are directly relevant to working through tough things.

I think this probably leaves some seam of intent between these concerns where it might make sense to fly out here to get face-to-face time, but I'm not sure what's in that seam and would be interested to hear more.

I don't foresee Wilkes or I resigning this week or probably even the next if we're working on shipping datomic, covering interrupt work, and trying to keep folks from being blocked, so there's a limit to how urgent things are in that regard. I know that no matter what emerges that we're trying to bring the system to the desired state, and one which future engineers have great tools to keep building features for a great product.

Cindy asked me many questions. My rough response was that it brings up so many problems I don’t even know which one to panic about first:

1. Rick and Wilkes leaving, possibly as early as next week
2. The need to recruit replacements while fundraising
3. The impact of doing so on the fundraising
4. The product not really working overall right now
5. Whether I can ever be part of a small team

Here, I attempt to craft a response. And probably provide a bucket for thoughts that could never go in a reasonable response:

Wow. There’s a lot there. I’m blown away.

The first part is easy:

I was already planning to get face time with at least everyone in engineering, probably in June. Cindy’s mom just got taken off of cancer meds, and this coming week has suddenly turned into the only week it’s realistically ok for me to be away. She could die next week, or in three months, or who knows? I have to be here for Cindy and my kids.

As to the motivations... I saw the risk of what you bring up: That I could go out there and exacerbate what you’re suffering from by trying to get control of things. Ten years ago Luke would likely have done so. I think I can largely avoid that today, although obviously I’m still me and I can not pick how you experience my behavior.

My motivation is higher level than that.

Our conversations over the last few months have been a confusing combination of useful, generative discussion and dysfunctional arguments. I’ve been whiplashed between, say, the conversation a couple of weeks ago when you said you could finally see things from my perspective, and wondered about that decision to have me avoid code, to last Friday where you basically said I’ve created a hostile work environment and you can’t stand working here. I get told you won’t build Muting as the team has spec’d it, but then can’t get you to provide any guidance on how to fix it.

My hope was that being in person provide some combination of context and time that would allow us to get the entire conversation out, and we could get to a state where we can confidently and comfortably communicate with each other again.

The goal was to get back to partnership.

Again, 2-4 weeks from now, after Datomic shipped but before other key prioritization decisions have been made, was better timing. I just can’t likely travel then.

Your message this morning indicates you’ve already made your decision, so there might not be much point. But if you are still going to be here in a month or two, we need to figure out how to work together instead of at odds.

I’m frankly mystified by how my behavior can be construed as a need for “intense control”, given how far I’ve been from so many engineering decisions and how hard I’ve worked to accommodate every demand you and Wilkes have made. Yes, I have heard you when you’ve expressed this opinion before. I can’t seem to get enough detail from you to understand and mitigate this, and no one else on the team is seeing what you’re seeing.

I’ve got a ton of respect for you and Wilkes. There have been times we’ve worked really well together. I’m absolutely up for fighting to find a way of working together that works for both of us, today and in the future.

But you’d have to want to fight for it, too.

If you have decided to leave, I need at least a month’s notice to ensure business continuity. I hope you see this is not a typical role where you’re just part of a larger team.

Things that I want to say but almost assuredly will not:



You’ve made it clear you don’t want to be in the product conversations, because coding is so much more important, but then you won’t abide by decisions made in those conversations. We’ve done everything we can, everything you’ve asked, to make them more accessible, but they’ve just been ignored.

I don’t mind not being the decision maker. But someone has to make them. I look at things like Muting, where you basically said no, you won’t build that, but then won’t do the work to replace it with something else, or work with me to come up with a better answer.

You’ve become a blocker for the main prioritization decisions. You’ve said in no uncertain terms you won’t build Muting as I spec’d it. You’ve got ideas for how to do some equivalent, but aren’t doing the work to carry those ideas to something that can be built. 



I’ve bent over backward to give you, and to a lesser extent Wilkes, everything you’ve asked for. We’ve got a hilariously minimalist process that’s barely changed in nine months. (I have no idea what process thrash you meant when you mentioned it.) I try to copy the Shape Up book as you recommend, but can’t get your engagement. I try to change the process — summarized RFC emails, for example — to accommodate your requests, and those get ignored.
