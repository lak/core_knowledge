In theory, authenticity is one of my strengths. I can and will directly expose to you who I am, how I work. In practice, I am very careful. I choose what to expose. It is not true authenticity.

Partially that is because I am unclear on exactly what that would look like. Does anyone really know who they are? What their authentic self presents as?

There is no such thing. We are not so simplistic. There are layers, aspects, exposures. Struggling to label one collection as our true self is reasonable.
