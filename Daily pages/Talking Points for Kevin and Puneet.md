# Talking Points for Kevin and Puneet
(Copied from Evernote 18 months after the fact.)
•	What causes you at this point to feel this way?
•	What changed between the recent conversations where you said you were impressed, and this decision?
•	There are real problems with Sanjay that I haven't exposed to you, although I have to Jennifer a little bit (be concrete)
•	What do you think we have been building? What makes the company special, and what makes you think Sanjay will sustain that special?

Here are some ideas/question/suggestions for your convo with them today.  You might not want to discuss any of this but I thought I would throw some thoughts down on paper. 

1. Let's think this through together.  Is this the right move for Puppet now?

2.  Why from your perspective is it important to do it now?

3. Why from my perspective is it important to wait. 
   There are early troubling signs regarding Sanjay's leadership judgement and behavior (offer examples). 
       Discuss his immature response to your coaching (like him saying if you just want me to leave say so).  
       This is not the behavior of an executive that can look at  himself and reflect on his strengths and shortcomings and accept even minor feedback on shortcomings.
       Discuss the incidents with women.  These are troubling.  Without direct oversight like what Luke is doing with him about these behaviors, the Board runs the risk of        having to exit him for inapropriate behavior  (it happens and I am sure they know how costly it is to do so). 
       Sanjay's response to Luke signals: I can't tolerate even minor feedback, and I don't see it the way others see it (again, woman example).  Very troubling indeed. 
       What the Board sees is perhaps the bright side of Sanjay's leadership behavior.  Not sure they are seeing the shadow side.  Luke can see it because he is with him        every day. 

4. Explore their thoughts about Sanjay's leadership track record vs. yours. 
   You don't know him/we don't know him well enough to take this risk.  

5. Explore their thoughts about your leadership of your execs and the team.  Do they think that you just keep turning turning turning execs and that you can't manage strong people? Have they talked about this?  I know this was in your performance review from about 2 years ago.  There was specific improvement language in the performance review about team leadership.  From the outside in, it looks to me like you have been working on team leadership.  The offsite in May or so was an example.  And you took in their feedback.  The difference is no one got the same opportunity for depth feedback like you did.  What were the undiscussables in the room for each leader?  You got yours but did they get theirs?  Every leader has a shadow.  Not just the CEO.  You will have to take this leadership of people and teams head on with them in the convo as this is probably one of the reasons they want to remove you.  They perhaps believe it is untenable.  And the question you have to reflect on, is it untenable?  And if so, how do you change that vs. just sail into the sunset.  Why do they think that Sanjay's team leadership will be fine.  I imagine they have no idea how he is behaving.  You have to clearly articulate this.
