# Why I Must Quit Drinking
At the end of my freshman year in college, I quit smoking weed. I’d smoked since I was 13 or so, and while I enjoyed it in high school, by the time I quit it was an annoyance. It interfered with what I wanted to do, and I didn’t enjoy how obvious it was to me that I was impaired. I once kicked a group of friends out of my dorm room so I could do my calculus homework, because we were all just sitting around drooling, and I needed to do something. That homework was unpleasantly difficult.

Through the rest of college, I wasn’t straight edge, but I didn’t drink or smoke. I wasn’t opposed to it, just not interested. By the end of college, I’d begun to drink at least sometimes, and the last semester, “to get through my thesis”, I was drinking nearly every night. By graduation, I was dating Cindy and in the habit of drinking, without ever intending it. Habits are hard to break on your own, but nearly impossible when sharing an orbit.

Over the years, we have drunk more or less, and while it’s rarely been a problem for us, it’s also never been far away. This is an article about me, not about Cindy, but it cannot solely be about me when I’ve shared my life so closely with someone for more than twenty years.

I often think back to the time before I ever drank, being confused by those who had the habit. I remember saying in the pool room one night that if Raia were in a fairy tale, it would be called “Raia and the beer”, because it was her constant companion. Yet here I am, 22 years later, and my own tale would have bourbon as my sidekick.

I have always been uncomfortable with my relationship to alcohol. I don’t mean that I don’t enjoy drinking it - just that I have rarely been ok with the fact that I do, and especially with how often I do. I am wistful when recalling the story of Feinman realizing on a beach in Brazil that he desired a beer mid-day, and foreswore alcohol for the rest of his life as a result. I am not saying he could not have done what he did without being sober, but I am envious of his decisiveness, and his comfort in his own skin. He did so much, so well, and yet found a way to apparently not suffer for who he was. I have lacked that ability to step away forever, but have always looked longingly for it.

This was exacerbated when, in retrospect, I got alcohol poisoning while visiting Joyent. I had nine drinks that night and probably should have gone to the hospital. For years after, if I had one drink too many — usually three instead of two — then I’d lose the whole next day to vomiting and misery. Yet even with this level of discomfort, I never quit. It was only years later, probably around 2013, that I quit for three months and finally seemed to be back to normal. Now I just get normal hangovers; they are not all-day, and they aren’t triggered as easily.

Yet even with my “normal” hangovers, I’ve lost uncountable productivity and happiness. I wake up with headaches more days than not, and one of the few cures for them just happens to be a painkiller that’s hard on the liver and thus should not be used in combination with alcohol. When you must find drugs that are compatible with and modulate your addictions, you have a problem.

Unlike apparently most people (I base this conclusion partially on the look of surprise on my doctor’s face when I told him this) my drinking improves people’s opinion of me. Pretty much everyone agrees I’m a nicer, happier, better person when I’ve been drinking, at least some. It’s unclear if or when it crosses over from asset to liability — three drinks? five? — but at least initially, everyone prefers tipsy Luke to sober Luke. I have used this fact to justify my continued drinking, in fact to make it not just acceptable but mandatory. I hate being the Steppenwolf, everyone shares that hatred, and I need all the help I can get to escape it, in both my work and personal lives.

I rarely exhibit the ability to not start drinking, but I am never able to stop. I can modulate, keeping my input to no more than a drink an hour or so, but when you start at 5, or 7, and go to bed at 11, that’s no victory. It is disappointingly common to have five drinks in a night, and shockingly rare to have less than three. Too many mornings begin with my attempting to count just how many drinks I had the night before. I remember them all, but sometimes only after triple counting. I would love the ability to have a single drink with dinner, or even two, but the hardware that would provide that moderation seems to be alcohol’s first victim.

These aren’t why I need to quit drinking.

I am afraid of quitting. Deeply afraid.

I am afraid for my heart. I have a family history of heart issues, and I know I have a weird heart, even if I don’t know exactly how or where. Given my family and the data on alcohol’s positive effect on heart health, I fully believe quitting now has a good chance of letting my heart kill me prematurely. This is more poignant this week of Sam's tragic death.

I am afraid for my work. Some of it is about being a pariah, not wanting to sacrifice what little social capital I have by not partaking. A lot of it is just fear that I won’t be able to be someone people like if I don’t drink. Unlike the fear above, this one I think I can overcome — the alcohol is exposing a version of me, not creating one. I can learn to be that person, and I can do so without drugs, but it is enough to frighten me.

I am afraid of missing out. So much of life is around a raised glass. So many relationships, so much culture, is built while partaking of the local drink. What else am I giving up by skipping that? I am afraid of the answer.

I am afraid for my family. I am afraid my marriage is dependent on modulating who I am, on stepping behind a waterfall of alcohol so that nicer, number, more tolerant, and probably more present Luke shows up. I am afraid of the fidgetiness I get when too long in my brain, and that this will just make our relationship too much harder. I think this is solvable, but still fear.

I am afraid of the Steppenwolf taking over. I am afraid of that feeling of enlightenment I had in college, when all was clear and nothing mattered, all was connected but nothing could be touched. I was so strange and so powerful that I could get near no one. My love for Cindy blossomed in part because she helped pull me out of that, she helped connect me to the world, and I don’t want to lose that connection.

These fears are why I drink.

But I also drink because I love drinking. Part of it is that I love drinking all things — soda, vinegar, soda and bitters, wine, liquor, cocktails, beer, bitter italian sodas, fruit juice, water, just about literally everything. You put three glasses of any potable liquid in front of me and it will all be gone by the time anyone else finishes one.

Like all addicts, I have come to love the habits, the ontologies, the systems of drinking. I love the different flavors, the knowledge I’ve developed in making and imbibing, the variety of flavors, the unique experiences I can mix from a bottle.

I love how alcohol is a part of where you are. The Czech Republic is different if you don’t drink the Pilsner Urquel while you’re there. France without wine, Japan without Sake, England (or Portland!) without beer, the south without Bourbon, New York without cocktails. My house without a great whiskey of every variety, plus a couple of brilliant cocktails on offer. How could I ever have the same experience?

As the above makes clear, unlike cannabis alcohol seems to numb the self-doubt and cynical centers of my brain, leaving me feeling present, and blissfully unaware of the extent to which I’m impaired. This is both alcohol’s benefit and its danger, especially for someone like me who constantly feels the layers of reality pressing in. Alcohol collapses those layers in a way that nothing else does for me, which is partially what drives the addiction.

I enjoy being under the influence of alcohol, both early and late. I enjoy the early simplicity that comes from ratcheting back my mental machinery and reducing my stutter step of self doubt. I have also come to enjoy, and fear, the numbness and floating that come late. Both are themselves enjoyable, and especially provide relief from the difficulties of life, and that relief is a rush of pleasure compared to the dissipating pain. 

As Dr. Hindin said, I am self medicating, and he was clearly implying that if I needed medicine, I was sick.

Even with the fears, I must quit drinking. It hurts to write it.

I do not know what an alcoholic is. One friend quit drinking after waking up three states away, having lost his pants and his car. Another spent time living under a bridge before going sober. Those are not me, nor are those my risks. I sit and drink, and my core systems for deciding good and bad stay generally intact. The few failures exhibit as poor wording rather than poor actions.

Yet I keep thinking of the line: If you drink when you did not intend to drink, and you drink more than you intended to drink, then you are an alcoholic. “Quitting smoking is easy; I’ve done it hundreds of times.” Many of my evenings have begun with a sober plan and ended deep in the cups. Deciding to just have one is too easy, and once the seal is breached, one becomes three, or five. Just having one more is never too big of a leap. My constant awareness of the need to quit only increases my drinking — “this might be the last night!”

I have spent countless mornings lying awake in bed, miserable and convinced that today, today I would not drink, and that from now on, I will do things differently. The last year or so, I don’t believe myself. I no longer have credibility even within my own head.

I just spent two months on the road with my family, and I think I spent one night sober. Worse, I likely averaged — over 62 days — more than four drinks a night, possibly five. I was active enough, and out of sorts enough, that my hangovers were generally clear by the time breakfast was over, but I had at least a mild hangover essentially every day. For most of those 62 days I woke up feeling crappy, for at least an hour or two, and yet tucked back in each night to do the same thing.

I don’t want to quit. I want to be the kind of person who can partake casually, who can step back, who doesn’t have to draw one, hard, final line. The data I have suggests I cannot be that person. I appear to be able to choose not to drink, or to drink too much and too often.

I have made rules, and sometimes even followed them for a little while, but never long enough, and never consistently. No drinking at home, no drinking unless guests are over, no drinking after 9, no drinking on week days, no liquor, no more than two, no more than three, always go down in alcohol percentage, and many more. “Ok, I’ll do that, except…” There are always exceptions. There’s always an out, and you can bypass that opportunity only so many times. Once you take it, you’ve lost credibility, and the rule doesn’t work ever again. With almost any rules, it’s straightforward to set things up so I’m still drinking essentially every night, and more than I should.

To an extent I’m being hard on myself. It’s not unreasonable to self-medicate in response to my firing last year, and this summer’s indulgence is a response to the difficulties of the trip and its preparation. The past year has been an extended anomaly, and I was poor at stress management for a couple of years prior. It’s reasonable to think I’ll revert to a more normal level again once I acquire a new set of habits. It’s an opportunity to reset, and at least in theory that reset should not require such hard lines because it’s such a big opportunity.

Except… except… I lost a day a month to hangovers for years running, yet kept at it. I lost a full day on almost every international trip yet wouldn’t travel sober. I spent most of a year not being able to drink beer because my body violently rejected it, yet rather than taking this as a sign to avoid alcohol I just found a less reactive poison. I lose time every day, every week, every month, to the recovery from drinking, but also to the drinking itself.

 Because that's the real problem.

I must quit drinking because I am not who I want to be, and I cannot see a path to being so without quitting.

I am not physically fit, and never will be if I continue drinking 700 calories a day. I do not love myself, and have not come close since that sober stint in 2013 when I lost significant body fat for the first time since I quit Mountain Dew after college. Every time I sit the discomfort at my waist reminds me of the fat I’m carrying. No amount of exercise or dieting can compensate for consuming a third of your daily recommended calories in alcohol, and of course, exercise is materially more difficult when you wake up feeling like shit every day and you need to set aside each night for drinking.

I feel no edge any more. Yes, I’m 42, not 18, and I cannot expect the level of intensity I felt in my youth. I am on the long slow decline, and my mental acuity might never be at the same level again. But I can tell. The compromises press in on me. I feel the slackness between thoughts, the disconnection that every night’s relief brings. How can you practice mindfulness when you spend six hours a day impaired specifically in that part of your brain? How can you travel long roads of thought when each evening is a blotter on the day’s search?

Some of it is about the actual time I lose. I am not a morning person, and I do not think I can ever become one. I am most alive at night, and even if night is no longer available, later will always be better for me. Except now, I cannot work at night. Yes, family is part of it, but family is just an excuse when you rule out cogent thought after 5pm every day.

In truth, my life has changed enough that I can largely rule out doing my best work at night, at least consistently. I can’t go on walkabout until 3am any more; not and wake with the kids at 7:15, or get to an office by 9. I also can’t plug in fully and put in my extra three hours when the kids are in bed. As painful as it seems, I do largely need to accept society’s schedule.

Even within that schedule, one cannot deny the costs of reduced mental capacity for such a large portion of my waking life. It’s not just about processing power, it’s about continuity. When I lay my tools to rest with a clean brain at the end of the evening, I find them in the morning where I expected them, cluttered and stacked but well understood. When instead I slowly release them as the alcohol relieves my stress, I find them scattered throughout my life the next day, like cast off clothes when running to the beach. I’m far past not knowing where to find things; I rarely can inventory what I should be looking for, or even muster the conviction that there is such a thing.

Would I have done better at managing Puppet if I were sober? Would I have recognized and tackled the key problems, if I had not given myself the right of relief at the end of a long day? What would have happened if I had not switched from proactive deep thoughts to reactive day by day execution? It’s impossible to say, isn’t it? It might be that I am reacting to my fear that I let this happen to Puppet, and I am using alcohol as an excuse.

Except… Except… I have always wanted to not drink. It’s not that I wanted to quit, or wanted to give up all these things, but I always look enviously at those who have foregone alcohol. “Ahh, to be allowed that…” I say to myself wistfully.

It is impossible to predict what life I’ll have if I can sustain abstinence. My fears do not just go away for my having written them down, and the shivers they cause point to a truth. But today, the lifelong confusion at my not being sober, plus the downsides to my physical health, all intersect with my conviction that daily impairment has dulled me too far. It is too much, and this past year pushed me undeniably far from who I want to be. I have drunk enough in this year to last a lifetime, even if I never woke up in someone else’s clothes.

It’s not all fear. I must sit up straight, lift my head, and ask, what do I want to do? What will this enable me to do?

Without alcohol, many easy answers and simple decisions are denied me, and being forced to take a harder road is what I need, and who I am. If I am not done doing, then I need to resharpen myself, and while it will not be pleasant, it is required to get from here to there.

I cannot credibly make a claim to be trying to do great things while continuing this level of compromise in my life.

I must quit drinking or I must admit defeat.
