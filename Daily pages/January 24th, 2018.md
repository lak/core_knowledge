The only thing that’s materially changed is my attitude. I’m in a disappointingly similar position, with the stock still illiquid and not looking that great, and my still not having a clear next step.

I’m a bit itchy to do something, ready to make some sort of at least short-term commitment, but I’m also feeling more than ever that my research is having some results. I’m thinking about different things, wrestling with different problems, and seem to be experiencing just the right combination of potential energy and routes to spend it.

I know I need to fix my work patterns. I’ve been pretty good (although not as much since the start of December) about keeping a writing habit, but have failed to do much beyond that. I need to get back to something that resembles a full work day, because otherwise I’m never going to land on anything.

I’m intrigued by this idea of a blockchain studio, mostly just from what I might learn — and I think I could do it in a way that increased my credibility rather than damaged it — but I’m also hesitant because I don’t really know anyone involved, and everyone involved so far is a white guy which does not give me hope.

There’s no question that the dominant force in my life right now is the uncertainty around Puppet. If I get liquidity in the next quarter, my life looks fundamentally different than if I don’t. And if I don’t soon, I have to assume I won’t ever, or at least, won’t for years.

I am just not working very hard. For the first time since I left Puppet, though, I feel like I might soon be able to. It’s obviously unclear what would happen if I doubled or quadrupled the hours I was putting in.

There are a bunch of small projects I’m interested in, but it’s hard to say they’d be anything but hobbies. Things I’d like to do but don’t really think could turn into anything. Nothing I’m thinking of is worthless, but it all takes the same amount of work in the first couple of years, and few of them would have the kind of return I’m interested in.

I’m just not that excited to start a venture fund, or any kind of financial entity, but also not that excited to start a software company.

The software areas that seem most exciting to me right now are mostly around distributed systems, reviving old protocols, asynchronous solutions, and related topics.

I’m intellectually very excited about financing solutions to problems that others don’t seem to care about, but at least at this point, I can’t seem to turn that into emotional excitement, into motivation.

I need to get my writing platform online. That’s got to be my top priority, because until it’s done, I can’t publish, but I must publish.

Also, I’m apparently out of writing topics, at least ones that are sitting there trying to force themselves out of my brain.
