# What Really Matters for me with the board
It comes down to two major disconnects, which have neither been heard nor managed.

First, I had an understanding of the situation based on the feedback I was getting, and this set of actions made no sense within the context of that understanding.

Second, if I could not stave off this decision, the board could have at least heard my concerns about how the company was going to be managed under the new leadership. Instead, my concerns were squashed or trivialized.

I am hurt and frustrated by other aspects of the transition, and I don't think I will ever be able to look at Lou with respect again, but most of what really bothers me falls into one of those two categories.

## My work as CEO
For the first time in my life as CEO, I was operating without fear. I was doing what I knew the company needed, in terms of strategy and execution, and I was questioning myself less than I ever had. In fact, the only reason I had been willing to take a gamble on Sanjay was that I thought I would be there to manage the risk.

More importantly than Sanjay, though, I was working steadfastly on the strategy changes the company needed. While I wasn't particularly thrilled with the changes in sales strategy, I did think they were probably the right answer, and either way, the best result was going to come from product strategy changes, not sales or marketing. Nothing has changed my opinion that the best thing Puppet can do right now is drive the product strategy I built, and do so as quickly as possible. We must focus on speed of adoption, across the entirety of each of our customers.

I also did some of my best work as a leader here, especially in marketing. I learned an incredible amount about how to build and deliver with a team, but also to trust myself and give myself permission to make a call that I couldn't objectively support.

What it comes down to, though, is that from everything I had available, I had assembled a board who had confidence in me and the experience to bridge us, I had freedom to operate, and I had a commitment for a couple of years to get this right. That led me to do things like hire Sanjay that I would never have risked if I didn't think I had the power to protect the company from him.

## Sanjay's fit for Puppet
Fundamentally, the board brushed off my concerns about him. In fact, I was told his flaws would likely be an asset, and I was told multiple times told that my departure was as likely to be celebrated as it was to be mourned. 

### Legacy One: Inclusion of women
It was clear to me already that Sanjay was going to quickly undo all the effort I'd made to make women feel welcome, empowered, and supported. He had in his short time shown a considerable amount of disrespect for the women who he had to work with, both in subordinate and peer roles. How he has treated Jamie is a very simple example of this.

This absolutely is one of my most important legacies, and putting someone in place who would shutter it is a massive smack in the face to me.

### Legacy Two: Listening Leadership
As a leader, I have always made myself available, and more importantly, I have always listened to people. It's true that not everyone took me up on it, and it's definitely true that I didn't just do what people wanted, but one of the major reasons I kept the trust of the team over the years is they could tell that I heard them.

Equally clear was that Sanjay was not going to continue that legacy. He has shown little interest in listening, and even when he has asked for feedback, he does all the actual talking.

## Final Point
The process itself made a lot of this hard. Kevin worked very hard to say to me that I had control, but I pointedly didn't want it. He pushed me into a boat, demanding that I sail, but left it up to me how I'd sail and where. I think we could have had a better transition, and a better plan, if someone else had taken a more active hand. I couldn't do it, because I couldn't build a great plan for accomplishing a goal I didn't believe in, and no one else really stepped in.

Also, there was a ton of pressure for me to publicly support Sanjay. I still can't decide if this was good or not. Most of the company doesn't believe it, and anyone who interacts with both of us either has lost total faith in me, or can only believe that I didn't support it or made a massive fuck-up. For the rest, and for the market in general... It's probably good the wider world doesn't know quite as much how the company was struggling for a while, and a peaceful transition helps to hide some of that.

For me, though, that one lie pays out over the years, and my big question is when I get to stop with the lying. When can I tell the truth about the transition, and what really happened? How long do I need to keep telling a partial truth, or supporting someone I don't believe in?

# Conclusion
I do not know if I can ever trust the board as a whole again, or the individual members. No one has put out energy to try to rebuild a relationship with me, which is pretty notable.  I have put out a good amount of energy with nearly everyone, and it hasn't really been reciprocated.  Puneet has made the trip up, but our conversation there hasn't gone anywhere else.

It does feel like my best course from here is to divest as fast as possible. The sooner "Puppet" isn't me, and I declaim control or responsibility, the better, I think. I don't know if that's the right answer financially, but it seems the right answer spiritually.
