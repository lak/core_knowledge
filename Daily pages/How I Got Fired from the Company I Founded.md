# How I Got Fired from the Company I Founded
This is a complicated story, in part because it’s a personal story. I think the facts have merit for founders in potentially similar positions, but I couldn’t possibly tell the story without my personal experience of it, nor without my analysis of the what and why.

It’s worth having some background on Puppet, because otherwise much of this won’t make sense.

I started Puppet in 2005. I founded it for multiple reasons, but they can probably be best summarized as these:
* I had run out of other good ideas for what to do in my career as a sysadmin, but I was absolutely sure I needed to move on from that career
* I figured it would be better to fail at starting a company than succeed at getting an MBA (which I wasn’t interested in) or JD (which I was interested in), in terms of both cost and worth to me
* I was confident it was a good business opportunity. I also had a software company for scientists planned out, but concluded Puppet was a better business for multiple reasons

After 3 years, I brought in two friends to work with me. After another year (in June 2009), we were offered a round of funding by True Ventures, which we accepted - it ended up being $2.25m, with Kevin Compton of Radar Partners and Glenn Winokur also joining as minor investors (although Kevin invested about 10x what Glenn did). Over the next 5 years, we raised a total of $87m from True, Kleiner Perkins, VMware, Cisco, and Google Ventures.

By the end of 2014, I concluded it was best for everyone if I left the company, finding a successor.

To many, this was a surprise - they were convinced Puppet was my baby, that I loved the space, the tech, the users. However, I had been miserable for years. It’s bad narrative, but I’ll drop into why.

The biggest reason is that I didn’t feel good at my job.  I’m not saying I wasn’t good; I’m saying I didn’t feel good. Most of us know the difference between doing something we are good at, and doing something we are not good at. I love the struggle of something new, and the feeling of that struggle gradually being replaced by skill and comfort, by an understanding of the system you’re working in. Many of us have experienced that especially great feeling of flow, when you’re doing great work in a system you are skilled at using tools that make you better.

Well, I never got to the point where I really experienced flow very often as a CEO. It was my job to aggressively discover areas of incompetence in the company, gain just enough competence that I could hire someone, and then do so and move on. Thus, I was constantly in the mode of learning the very earliest stages of new things, and never got to the point where I actually understood anything to a level of depth.

In addition to my being unhappy, though, I made nearly everyone I worked with unhappy, too. It’s the weirdest thing. A lot of the people at Puppet really loved working there, and felt like they did great work, but a lot of people I worked directly with also said they had their worst-ever work experience in a room with me. It wasn’t just the daily interactions, though: On an ongoing basis, I made the people around me miserable. Yes yes, I know my job is to constantly up level them, to put pressure on them to improve. But shouldn’t it also be my job to help them succeed?  Well, the people around me never succeeded, either by my definition or (usually) theirs. When no one is succeeding, no one is happy.

I tended to do much better with people one or two levels removed, in that I tended to be happier with their work, and they tended to be happy at the company. A lot of this is that I understand management well enough (usually) to know that I shouldn’t be giving much in the way of direction to people who don’t work directly for me, but I also understood that it was my team’s job to make decisions and manage their teams, so when working in different parts of the org I could focus on doing the work, rather than on whether the individual was successful or not.

Ok, so I was unhappy, and I made everyone around me unhappy.

I also had a company I didn’t like. I am incredibly user-oriented, and I despise even the existence of buyers, much less needing to cater to them, yet our sales model had morphed into an enterprise model that I was not proud of. It made us money, but I didn’t like how expensive each customer was, nor did I like what we needed to do to keep them happy. I’m not saying it’s wrong, just that it isn’t my cup of tea. If I ever start another software company, I’m going to work incredibly hard to only sell to smaller companies; or at least, only sell in the way smaller companies buy.

It wasn’t just our sales. We had followed success, allowing our product to become more complicated (because big customers can handle an expensive install and upkeep), and focusing on adding features big companies wanted but ignoring things that got new smaller teams in the door. We over-solved our customer problems, and became less important to them.

I was in a space other people thought was interesting. For most people this is great - it’s easier to get coverage, employees, fame, etc. For me, it was horrible. I hate losing, but I also don’t particularly like competing. I prefer to pick competitions I know I will win, which means I tend to focus on areas people just aren’t interested in. By the time everyone agrees it’s a good idea, like Puppet in 2015, I’m over it.

I was frankly bored of our product, our customers, and our industry. Not that I couldn’t find interesting things in what we did, just that fundamentally it wasn’t the thing I was most interested in. I was having the same sales calls with the same skeptical sysadmins I’d been having for more than 10 years, and I was tired of them.

I was tired of the monogamous relationship I had with Puppet. I wanted to do other stuff, think about other industries, understand other areas, but Puppet took more time and energy than I had available.

So, I decided to hire a successor. I did all the right things: Hired a great search firm, talked to the best candidates, etc. But I failed. I couldn’t even convince most people that I wanted to leave, and the few I could, wouldn’t take the job. In the end, Portland was always the problem. No one who deserved the job was willing to be in Portland for it.

So, six months into my search, I made a big mistake: I gave up on a CEO search and focused on a COO instead. I would give Puppet another 2-3 years, rebuild my exec team (which was obviously necessary by that point), and by the end of that time, I’d either have the company and job I wanted, or the COO would be in a great place to be my successor.

Well, it took six months to find that COO, and the first 3(!) people I offered it to turned me down, again because we were in Portland. I got the third rejection while visiting my family over Thanksgiving, and I really clearly remember standing in a corner of the pantry, hoping no one could see me, as I cried. I had no hope.

I ended up hiring the next person on the recruiter’s list. The biggest reason was frankly because I didn’t have many other options. My relationship to the recruiter was breaking down, and if I didn’t hire this guy I was going to have to restart the search with a new recruiter, which would put me back at least another three months.

I knew this hire was a risk, but he was less of a risk than some I had tried to hire. I was confident he brought the operations and go-to-market skills we needed, but less confident in our relationship. I didn’t like taking a risk, but hiring him and having to fire him in a couple of quarters was a better bet, in my opinion, than holding off on hiring him. We really needed help, and I was implicitly confident in my board supporting me in whatever I decided needed to be done.

Unfortunately, he couldn’t start for another five months. So, even though I’d started the search in January of 2015, our COO didn’t start until May of 2016. By that time, our need for GTM leadership was critical, as we’d had multiple bad quarters in a row.

Within three months of his starting, it was clear to me that I’d made a mistake in hiring him. He did, in fact, have exactly the skills we needed, but he was also never going to be able to work with or for me. We were too different on too many areas, and he was never going to be able to align to a lot of my key goals, such as low sales cost, or diversity and inclusion of women. He had already multiple times demonstrated that he did not respect the women on my team or his, and when I tried to discuss it with him, he flipped out.

My talking with him about this clearly scared him. He had a conversation with my two most senior board members, and within two weeks, I was fired. They maintain it had nothing to do with his conversation with them, and I believe them that he made no ultimatums, but it’s too much for me to believe that it’s a coincidence that the same day I had enough information to realize he needed to commit to my goals or walk, instead I was the one who walked.

From there, it was a huge cluster fuck. The board, and Kevin especially, worked hard to make it seem like a respectful process to me, but it was too late for that. The board had been nothing but complementary to me in the quarters prior, and from my perspective, this was essentially sudden. To him, respect was letting me handle it how I wanted, but to me, respect was in how the decision was made. Once the senior investors were decided, it took no effort for the rest of the board to get in line.

My first discussion with Kevin and Puneet didn’t help. I listened, was receptive, but came away with the conclusion that this was already decided, so it was a question of process from here. Over the course of the next 48 hours I learned that it was not, in fact, decided, and that the board wasn’t aware of it over all. This caused me to back down from some of my acceptance, which seemed to confuse them, and once I realized what was happening and why, I began to express my developing opinions that this was a mistake.

Because I really did think that. That is, I was essentially ok with my not being CEO, although I was unhappy with the process, but I was (and am) convinced that Sanjay was not the right fit for the company. The only way for him to succeed as CEO of Puppet was to remove anything about it that was my legacy, because that’s how different we were. I didn’t think the company could survive that level of disruption.

In the end, I did what I thought the board wanted: I told my company that it was mutual, that I supported Sanjay in the role, and that I was excited about the transition. When pressed, I was able to truthfully say that I had been looking for a successor for a long time. With some, I said it was my plan and the board’s timing. And eventually, with most of my direct team, I admitted that I did not choose this and wouldn’t have, at least not this way.

We built a plan for six months of transition time, with no real idea of whether Sanjay would ask much or little of me. The first month after the announcement was busy preparing for the PuppetConf keynote, but once that was done, my responsibilities have essentially ended. Sanjay has asked to meet with me twice, and both of those times he did far more talking than listening, so he clearly was not seeking my input or advice.

Realistically, I have no relationship with any of my board members except Kenny at this point. He’s the only one who understood the magnitude of what they were deciding, or who seemed to take responsibility for the consequences of the decision. Everyone else seems to be expecting me to get over it, and surprised that I’m this upset. I obviously said some things that really upset Kevin, as at PuppetConf we had a conversation and from what I could tell, he was going out of his way to be hurtful. He said more directly negative things about me in that one conversation than he probably has in our entire relationship before that.

Regardless of how it happened, I’m relatively free now. 98% of my net worth is tied up in Puppet, but I don’t have much control in how it plays out from here so it is not much of a burden. I’ll be trying hard to get some liquidity, and hopefully even sell the company, but otherwise, I’m focused on what’s next for me.

I’d love to capture this as two different stories, one of my personal journey and one as a series of facts to warn other entrepreneurs. For now, we’ll have to settle for the stream of consciousness that is this letter.
