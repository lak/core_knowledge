# On the road: What is my passion?
I finished Snowball, about Buffet. He obviously did something special, and was highly rewarded for it, but... what was the point if you don't use any of it while you're alive? And there's no way I could ever do what he did. I'm just not motivated by money, having it or spending it. Well, a little by spending it, but not really.

The end of the book does a good job of nailing the fact that he pretty much devoted his life to becoming the richest man in the world. In his own words he made clear that he knows he won the ovarian lottery, that that same drive in Lagos or Bhoutan would have meant little, but nonetheless, that drive was enough for him.

Contrary to the myth of his short days, he seems to have sacrificed most things to his goal. His wife left him (but not his money), his kids clearly have a mixed -- at best -- relationship with him. He has a lot of great friends, but their closeness tightly corresponds to his current obsessions.

Anyway. This post isn't about him, it's about me.

I don't feel like I have that same level of passion. There isn't a thing I want to accomplish. Left to my own devices I seem to do the same thing, but it's an activity, not an outcome. (Wow, that's weird, given my efforts over the years to get people to focus on outcomes, not activities.)

How to describe the thing I do? There are many ways.

Certainly an aspect is about removal, reduction, trimming, sculpting by eliminating the extra parts. Understanding the system then using any means necessary to make the system do its job with less waste, less input, less effort.

But that's not really it. If it were that, I'd be an operations person. It's more about the people than the system.

Can I say I really care about helping people focus? That I'm trying to remove from people's lives the things they don't want to do, that don't fulfill them, that don't get them closer to their goals.

I can't imagine building a software company that didn't do this, yet feeling it was a success.

I can imagine multiple ways of doing this as a career and feeling like I accomplished something.

I could start a single software company that helped a single group of people focus on their work. Puppet is one example of this.

I could go into finance and focus on helping to create and build companies that did this. I know of no such company.

I could focus my time on helping entrepreneurs who do this, helping them build these companies through my advice, abilities, and network, but not through financing them.

I have no idea how to decide between. I don't even know which choices are truly available.

I do think this is the closest thing for me to a passion, a drive.
