# Thinking about series(es)
I tend to think and write in themes, but I am uncomfortable planning out a series. Some of it is I think more infrastructure means I should have more help, but I also just think planning is usually wasted time.

However, I think the series framing is helpful. It forces a level of coherence, and also frames the sequence for the reader. 

Is there a way to get the best of both worlds?

Can I announce the launch of ‘a series of indefinite length’?

What is the value in this?
* Readers can be provided explicit links between them, making it clear they are related and sequential (to the extent possible without planning)
* Readers are informed that this is not a one-off, but rather a larger area of investigation
* Series can be closed, finished. This clear mark of completion provides its own information to the audience, and enables me to announce closure.
* I can work on multiple topics at once without feeling like I must stay in a single lane

What are the downsides?
* Some planning is useful, and without length-statements I will tend not to do it
* The writing itself would be improved the context created by quality planning
* It would keep me focused enough to finish a series
