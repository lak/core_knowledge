I cannot imagine living there, and I cannot imagine not living there.

For the first time in my life, I feel the need to be where the conversation is, to be physically near my collaborators.

Except, of course, the closest thing to collaborators I have right now are both in SF. Yay.

Watching The Dawn Wall made me want to be closer to Yosemite.
