I think I am struggling with 1000 word targets.

I want to write shorter pieces, almost sound bites, or longer ones, where I say more than one thing. This article on inhabiting your weird is a great example — no single point is very big, and the big point is too big.

This is somewhat related to the fact that I seem to be developing multiple large narratives. They’re all so tied together, and yet I can only write about the little pieces I can pull out and view by itself.

I think I am also challenged with how I’m writing. I am tiring of polemics, but have not found something to replace it with. Personal stories are great, but are still a struggle. Part of that struggle is just that some of these stories can’t get out yet — I can tell you what I learned, but not how I learned it. But at least part of it is that this is actually how I think and write: This is what you should do.

The stories hide their lessons too well. They’re more fun to read, and in some ways are thus more meaningful, but the deep meaning needs its own treatment. In so many cases, I didn’t understand the story when it happened, and the thing I’m trying to write about is the explanation that I only came up with much after the fact, after a bunch of thinking. 

Maybe I should experiment a bit with the GEB model: Tell a story, but then write the polemic.
