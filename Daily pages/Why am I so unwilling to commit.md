What’s the downside? What am I giving up?

I think it’s more about what I’m giving up than it is about downsides per se.

What do I give up?

I can’t run a company.

Or rather, if I do, I’ll take a credibility hit.

Is it that I’m afraid to fail as a studio founder? That I’m afraid to make this leap and miss?

It seems like a fear of failure. And maybe a specific form of failure? That is, I’m mostly afraid of failing in the same way that all of these seem to fail: Turns out I’m not such a genius, I’m just going to use this money to start a company. 

I really don’t want to give up those other things.

But do I? Let’s say I find a way to start that crypto db. I don’t have to run it. And really, I’m probably not even the right person to do so. 

I don’t think I lose much by not having my name attached.

But I can tell we’re getting somewhere now.

How does the studio increase my reach? How does it make my megaphone bigger? How can it be a platform for my reaching more people?

I’ve been very focused on reaching people through software, but it seems important to me that people respect me, know my name. I guess I want some form of fame or something.

Is that right?

Doesn’t the studio provide that platform?

Is it this: I know I should be hiring founders, not just entrepreneurs, and if I do that, then I don’t end up the person attached to the product. Therefore, success ends up being anonymous, behind the scenes.

If I had to choose between running the studio successfully, and making a lot of money, and starting a bunch of companies that did what we set out to do, vs getting famous, and running podcasts, and having books, which would I pick?

If I was only famous for being famous, if what I said had little credibility, then I think it would wear. I would not be able to stand it.

But I think it’s more important to me than I’ve been letting on.

I think I need to make it part of my plan.

I think part of why I did well at Puppet is because I thrilled at being on stage, at being in the center, at getting semi-famous.

This is the weekend’s goal: Fit the need for fame, for personal reach, into the studio’s model.
