# March 12, 2018 - too many options
I am currently somewhat stymied by wanting to invest in too many areas. It’s not so much that any of them are great ideas, but that they have a pull of some kind or other.

E.g., I’m really excited by the idea of a SQLite-like database but built on Merkle trees. I don’t think the tech by itself is super amazing, but the things I can do are compelling. For this case, they’re really only compelling because they solve a problem for me, rather than because I think they’d make a great product or a great business. They might, but... probably not. (These are version control and sync’ing for your photos, albums, contacts, etc.)

I’m also drawn to build each and every one of the gaps in my work life. Mostly right now this is calendar management, but because tasks and email are too big and have too much interest. Too much competition. I can’t think of the other things, but I’m confident there are many around this. Given Calendly, though, I expect I actually could build a reasonable business on many of these.

I’m still thinking about the lab notebooks, and the construction product. The former is more exciting than the latter, but also less likely to be a good business (I think).

Lastly, there’s that whole category of productivity, actually trying to bring lean values to the world of software. That’s exciting in some ways, and if I can do it effectively, it has the most potential upside. Like tasks and email, also quite frightening.

What I’m actually supposed to be doing is building the fund, building the studio. But most likely, the first steps in that are building the first company or two, which means something above needs to be started. Right?

I need to start something.
