It was very nice to get a bike ride in yesterday. Cities all seem alike, and there was nothing particularly memorable about Boulder, but I will not quickly forget the canyon climb alongside the creek, nor cresting Lee Hill road and seeing out over the valley.

That was a very tough board meeting. In some ways it was deserved: The numbers are changing too much, and are not consistent across the deck.

I don’t love being on the board with Dharmesh, regardless of whether he’s right. Talks too much about his expectations when he invested, rather than what the company needs. Just talks too much in general.

I was maybe naive in a couple of places - duh that the expectation is not the number - but overall I’m definitely learning more from the board seat, and I think I’m helping Caleb.

Ryan is surprisingly quiet.

I appear not to have slept last night. I don’t really understand why I cannot be sure - I likely drifted in and out a little, but was always more conscious than asleep. Time at least passed somewhat quickly.

I am feeling a bit deflated. I expect that is mostly just how I feel physically. But part of it is hanging out with these rich investors, being reminded of how big the gap really is.
