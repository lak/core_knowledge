On a plane to Berlin/Ghent/London.

It’s very strange doing international work travel but not for Puppet.

I’m still being hounded by the weight of uncertainty around Puppet’s stock.

I don’t know whether to be surprised that I seem to be equally stressed by how it affects my perception of my own success as I am by the actual cash aspects.

Not just the lack of capital, but the “maybe you’ll have capital soon” aspects, are leaving me in a kind of holding pattern.

And wow, finishing that VC series seems to have really taken it out of me. I don’t want to spend more time on that, but I don’t seem to have queued anything else up to work on.

I think this speaks to the importance of working on more than one thing at once. It is similar to how it went at Puppet; I had no other pursuits, so the transition was too expensive, and the monogamy was so extreme it’s driving a lot of my decision making now.

It’s confusing. I don’t feel like I want to do the work involved in venture capital, but I also don’t want to just try to build and run another company.

I also don’t want to find myself needing someone else’s permission or approval.

I’m intrigued by all the little stuff, and it’s not crazy to spend a few years just building those. I don’t know if it’s crazy to think about doing those long term, or if working on them for a while will clear things out of my brain.
