# Things I’ve learned from ‘several short sentences’
In just the first tranche of reading.

Think concretely about transitions. It is clear that I am too reliant on them. I am hesitant not to include them, and their absence causes me to connect sentences unnecessarily.

Minimize the distance between a sentence’s start and its meaning. It’s not that sentences should be short; it’s that they should get to the point, they should not wander their way there.
