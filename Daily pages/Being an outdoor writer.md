# Being an outdoor writer
I seem to have this fantasy of turning this two month trip into a published article in Outside Magazine.

I'm convinced it's realistic, but I'm not really sure why I care. I'm not saying I could definitely get it published, but it's at least a possibility. I just don't really know what's driving my interest. The writing? The outdoors? The outr√©?

At least part of it is to try to make this trip seem somehow "worth it", that it's advancing my life in ways that can be measured externally, with publications and such things.

Part of it is the Musashi pursuit of other topics. I probably should have taken more than that away from him (and I obviously did) but that one sticks out at me a lot. It would be more justified if I'd actually reached mastery anywhere.

I don't appear to have much to write about.

Or rather, I'm unwilling to write about the things I'm thinking.
