Looking back, I see it’s been six weeks since I clearly said I wasn’t moving, and here I feel like I’m still not.

Fear has gripped me. I am too aware of what I’m actually getting into. 

I also hesitate to let go of options. Choosing something inherently skips something else. Hiring a person sets you on a path, whose end I cannot know.

My self critic has taken over. It has given me just enough room to pause, to stop, to worry.

I just spent a day reviewing companies. If I start a studio, I don’t get to sit on the other side of the table any more. Honestly, I was not envious of them. Yet, I was. It was instructive to sit next to the investor, to realize how I was not aligned with her, either monetarily or spiritually. It’s hard to say how much of that difference is one of action vs structure; I might be more aligned with someone who I thought was more aligned with me. It’s true, also, that her following nearly every entrepreneur out the door gave me the impression of a bottom feeder, someone who needs to talk to everyone. I cannot be that kind of investor. 

There’s no question that I am still struggling with the split brain around being rich or not.  So many of my sentences, my ideas, my “what if”s, begin with theorizing a world with liquid Puppet stock.

It is also true that the closer I get to a set of ideas I love, the further I get from loving the studio.

This idea of a blockchain sqlite, with a central platform for storage, won’t let me go. It is not an obvious market opportunity, requiring leadership and perspective that are in rare supply. It brings tactical opportunity but long term potential, too. 

Can I not build that within the studio?

Is the studio not the right platform on which to perform these experiments?

It is.

What is holding me back?

The fact that once I decide, I can only move forward, no longer sideways. 

Also the fact that I need to raise money. The actual process is not fun, but more importantly, once money is raised I am committing myself to a path, to a set of promises made to a set of people.

It is also fair to say that yesterday reminded me just how long and how hard the slog is. Three years in I might still have no revenue. (Not that I would build this kind of company.) Five years in I might still have a cute business. (Not that I would accept this any more.)
