# Being afraid

On this trip, I've been waking up every four or five days, afraid. Afraid that my Puppet stock will be worthless, that the skills I've built have no value, that I won't find a thing to do, that I won't be able to generate money without giving up on things I care about. I don't like being afraid.

I saw a stat today that Warren Buffet at age 39 was worth 0.01% what he is today. On that path, I'll do ok, but Buffet particularly cared about getting rich. That's what he'd already practiced for most of those 39 years. What have I been practicing for all of my years? Do I care if they do or don't generate cash? 

I think I do. I've always eliminated pursuits that wouldn't have panned out as profitable careers, like pool.

But I care about a lot more than that, too, and I haven't really figured out how to reconcile them.

Or really, I don't really know what I care about yet. All this time, and I'm just not sure.

I know I really, really care about representation. But I don't think there's a thing I can do in that area that fits my other needs, of being profitable and also of the work I'd do.

I know I'm never going to be a finance person, someone who cares primarily about how the money grows. I want what I do to grow money, but I don't want that to ever be the only measure.

What am I great at? What do I care about?

These are the questions I need to answer when I get home.
