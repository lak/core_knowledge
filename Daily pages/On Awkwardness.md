# On Awkwardness
*An example of complicating the easy things*
It is a mental stutter step. A decisive move, interrupted.

I know the answer, and I take it. Once in motion, when it is too late, an interjection: Are you sure?

No. I am not. I cannot be. “Sure” is an epistemic impossibility.

Thoughts of confidence intervals and failure modes light an escape sign. But I’m already paused, in the middle of a step, balanced when motion is demanded. Stepping back is obvious, awkward, unforgivable. Stepping forward is pointless. Having already taken the double check, can I really not improve my answer?

Packing for travel this week induced a mental crisis. I have taken this trip hundreds of times. I have packed for this trip hundreds of times. My closet was identical for last week’s trip, for the five trips prior.

It took three tries, the middle only a thought, a hint, no actual move. A gesture, depression, settling back and putting it off.

I have learned to make a game first effort and then walk away. Ask the key questions, lay out a bad first hypothesis, then drop it all. The gears will churn in the background. The important problems will sit, obvious. Forcing a confrontation with the errors of my first try. And the final answer can be tuned by the next trip.

I meet this week for the first time with a board I’ve just joined. Wardrobe reuse is limited across days, as I join the same group for dinner one night and a meeting the next day. I attend a founder event for a Puppet investor, but a minor one who I don’t know well. I do not know if their coolness raises or lowers the formality.

My torso’s outer layer anchors my wardrobe. Blazers are too formal. Even when appropriate they cause great discomfort. Days on end, everyone in a jacket, and mine is wet rubber. Every move squeaks loudly, drawing repeat attention to my odd appearance, my not belonging. My fraud shines brightly in each little detail. Having read the right books and shopped at the right stores, I still get it wrong. In my mind. All in my mind, yet inescapably true.

In the time it takes to greet everyone, to shake each hand, I have questioned every choice except my hidden socks. Are my laces crossed appropriately? Will I be dinged for their slight roll as they approach the top of the shoe?

I kid. I wish my laces got the same spotlight as the buttons on my jacket. Is the sleeve’s last button hole functional? Threaded in red to draw the eye? Did I leave it unbuttoned to show out, or button it confidently? Or in ignorance? Do I remember Henry the VIII’s sometimes/always/never rule? So many tests.

I invert the problem. It’s not about the jacket. It’s about the shirt.

Button downs must be covered. When not, the sleeves must be rolled.

This knowledge is hidden, even from those those who hold it. Bemused, but nodding: “If you remove your jacket, you roll your sleeves. Of course.”

I do not roll my sleeves. I do not wear a jacket.

The problem is covering the shirt. Inside or out. I have tried sweaters, but the shoulders do not work. The shirt cloth refuses to sit flat, is never comfortable. The collar is also a problem. It looks stupid, sticking out of your head hole. It belongs in a magazine. A stupid magazine. Not on a person.

I solve this with cardigans. Collars, not V-necks or lapels. I prefer pockets, but rarely get them. Jacket-like, worn indoors.

My collection is perfect in the winter, covered for weather. The outer layer dresses it up or down. I have learned. I am comfortable.

Warmth defeats them. They are all too thick. No outer jacket could be thin enough. The weight is wrong, lacking reassuring heft. I lose the free style points that nice but different outerwear would have delivered. Stepping up to a scarf is nonsensical, unavailable. None of my tricks work.

This week’s weather is 50-60. Not hot, but too warm. At least, for me. For my answers. I’ll sweat freely when walking. Indoors will be too hot, outside too cold.

The two meetings with the same group demand separate cardigans. Their extra thickness upends my bag choice. This trip accommodates leaving luggage at the hotel; a rare boon. I am happy not to have to cart it with me all day. A broken foot accompanied me last time, extracting a high price for the extra weight.

A new, light gray cardigan is my first try, quickly abandoned. It is unlikely to ever make it outside. I should not have bought it, no matter how warm and soft.

My go-to orange option sticks first. Its mate is woolly, thick, dark gray. It will be even hotter inside, and its loose knit even draftier out. Social comfort over physical. I believe people’s declarations of this one’s awesomeness.

I hate jeans. They pinch, their pockets suck. Unforgivably so. I wear them anyway. They collapse the stutter step. America’s camouflage, worldwide. Daily physical discomfort is preferable to incessant doubt. I wear selvedge, but do not roll the pant leg. My proof that I have nothing to prove. I can move on, secretly confident that I know more about fancy pants than you. I am only taunted by how hard it is to find a pair I like even a little. I find it hilarious that my uncommon hatred of jeans does not protect me from their stereotypically difficult fit.

The money I have spent on shoes would shock you. It is mostly wasted. Footwear is purchased for looks and worn for comfort. It makes for an interesting chart. These days I forgive myself for sacrificing looks. Still, the rules must be followed. I do not love my current options, but I can accept them.

I once hired someone to improve my wardrobe. “You just need some basics,” she muttered, upset, “some basics.” Everything was patterned, colored, interesting. It had to be toned down. Shoes and jackets. Those can be weird. Everything else should be normal, simple, plain. The basics provide a platform for expression by having none.

I have achieved this in pants, but not yet in shirts. I have to throw them all away, start again.

In the meantime, I pick one of the few successes, plus a purple check. It will work with one cardigan, not the other. That should be fine. Mmm, should.

I do not take out my earrings. The holes remain anyway. We can admit why they’re there.

The toiletries are consistent. No changes needed. There are no witnesses. I plan to shave. Two nights, board meeting on the last day, I should appear clean-shaven.

I choose my smallest, most used shoulder bag. For a woman this would be a purse, but I am supposed to call it a satchel, or even, smugly, a map case. It fits my iPad and a water bottle. I will leave my camera this time. It’s probably the right choice.

A small duffel holds everything else. It is beautiful leather. Its clumsy carry resonates with the posed awkwardness of advertisements, such that I feel captured in one. Only noticed recently, the importance of bags in fashion magazines still takes me by surprise.

I tuck in a cap and some gloves. Unlikely to be used, but thin and brilliant. I smile thinking of them.

I sit. I am decided. Dressed, packed, but time remains. The car will be called in half an hour. My decisions will sit for thirty minutes, uncommitted but unchanging.

This is easier now. Before, I would have stood in my bedroom. Picked up each piece, put it back down. Unpacked, repacked. Put it all in a different bag, put it all back.

I know I will fail with this trip, this wardrobe, this collection.

That failure is unlikely to inform the next one for the better.

My effort, I know, is all wasted. No one notices. No one cares. Anyone who does deserves only contempt. I am permitted to care. No one else. My shoelaces have received more thought than most people’s wardrobes, because of how little I care. The irony does not escape me.

I cannot stop. I cannot skip it. I must still try. I must iterate. I must recast the things I want and the things that are possible until an acceptable combination comes up.

All this. Just to walk out the door.

Imagine my difficulty when it matters.
