Thank you for your time and energy today. I appreciate your feedback on the studio, and it will be very helpful in figuring out what’s next.

And I know the discussion about Puppet was not easy, but I do appreciate that you were willing to have it, and I feel like we were able to see the other’s position, at least part of the time.

Your comment as we separated made me realize we’re using this word to mean different things.

People talk about two kinds of respect, and if you aren’t clear on which you mean, it’s hard to communicate: “respect my authority” vs “respect me as a human”.

I am not saying I deserve credit for what I built. Mostly, because this is a given, but also, because it does not matter to me.

What does matter is that I’m considered a peer, someone who adds value right now. For that, I need to be considered thoughtful, insightful, useful.

If my comments come off as emotional, or off the cuff, then I’m not useful. If I cannot separate what I personally want, or how I feel, from what I think is objectively best for the company, than I’m just not professional.

I think I do pretty well at those. Not that I do perfectly — no one does — but I strive, and in my opinion, largely succeed. I certainly bust my ass every minute of every board meeting to be useful and to contribute without ever detracting.

I do make mistakes. I think most of them are lack of experience, but I’m sure I sometimes fail to be sufficiently thoughtful. If I frequently sin, though, it is not generally through lack of thought, or effort. If anything, I do too much of that, not too little.

So, when I ask for credit, I am asking to be treated as someone who thinks deeply and frequently about the things I’m bringing up. I may sometimes fail to speak coherently of this, because who else can I even discuss it with? But failure there is not because I have not put the time in, or have nothing to add.

Given that I believe I do add value, that I have thought deeply, that I am insightful, I am only asking to be treated as someone who is in the room because he deserves it today, not because of what he did yesterday.

And if you don’t believe I deserve to be there for what I can contribute right now, then at least respect me enough to tell me you don’t think I deserve to be in the room any more because I have nothing to add. Not that I should leave because of leadership issues, but because I am just dead weight now.
