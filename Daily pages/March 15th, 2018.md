There is a deep relationship between my interest in supporting labor instead of capital, and it is related to wanting to build what we’d call a capitalist company.

That is, I want a company with an internal free market, because that enables people who don’t have access to lots of capital to make high quality decisions that have a big impact.

It’s also more fair, but it’s not just that; it’s better.

Pro-labor, but pro-free market.
