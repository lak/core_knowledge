# Starting a software company
I've begun listening to a podcast by Allison something-or-other at Business Insider, talking to founders about how they succeeded.

It made me hungry again to start another company, even though everyone involved has been working on their company for years.

Why? What is the appeal?

I've also been thinking about trying harder to do my little projects, to write my inbox app, to start my github for scientists project, things like that.

Of course, if I had a ton of money, these would be easier. I would just start experimenting and not worry too much about whether it would work out.

If I didn't feel like a dilettante, again, it would be easier. If I didn't want to feel like one.

I'm obviously afraid to commit to anything right now, but to an extent that's reasonable, given the summer plans.

There's definitely something else going on.

Heh. I don't actually have any good ideas right now for a software company. 

I'm in love with my little projects above, but not actually convinced they're good businesses.

I'm totally convinced that anyone who can crack productivity will make an ungodly amount of money, but not convinced I actually can crack it.

I think there's a ton of money available for industry-specific productivity tools, but I don't actually have a list of industries to work on.

I'm still in that drifting state. I've done enough writing that I know the shape of it, and it's time to either commit to really being a writer, or step back and just focus on getting a topic a week out the door. I know I won't be able to produce a book this summer, it just won't happen, but I do think I've got one or two books I could write, and that could be valuable.

I'm just repeating myself here. Yay.
