# Struggling to write about strategy
I seem to have somewhat broken the dam in my writing about productivity, successfully getting a piece or two out. I’m still completely blocked on strategy, though. 

It seems like I should try to write a much longer piece. What would this look like as a 5000 word piece? Could I write something even longer?

Is length my actual problem?

It seems like I have some pretty simple beliefs about it, but I can’t yet express them in a simple way.
