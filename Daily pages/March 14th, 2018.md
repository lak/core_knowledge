## Still Fucked
It’s been a tough week.

Touring that huge house just reminded me how fall I’ve fallen, in my own mind, at least. Combining that with the long discussion of Puppet and Sanjay was just brutal.

Then meeting with Dan and Jim yesterday, I got too emotional, too self-indulgent. I think.

And then the board dinner and today. It’s a wrapped up ball of misery, fear, discomfort, and wanting to be a competent executive but knowing I’m not allowed to be.

The discussion with Jim yesterday gave me a lot to think about. It’s not so much that he convinced me I’m making a mistake in doing anything but building... but he certainly made a play at it.

I’m still really struggling. Being smacked in the face with Puppet still hurts a lot, still knocks me on my ass and causes emotional and logistical brain freeze.

But I’m also struggling to make anything like a decision. I want to build a company, but don’t have one to build. I want to start the studio, but that basically just means coming up with that first company or two. I want to invest, but I don’t actually want to. 

I’m failing here to capture the actual struggle. 

I don’t want to commit to anything. I am fine working hard, but nothing in front of me is big enough or awesome enough to commit to, it seems like. I don’t have the cash to do it all myself, and I don’t want to raise money. I’m not even sure what I’d be raising money for. How much does money even matter?

I think Michael Dearing is right. I need to sit down and model it out. Get tactical. How many employees should I have in six months? A year? What’s my first product?

## Coming back again
One of my problems is that I know I’m too interested in the problem/solution side of the table. I would not make a great investor because I don’t think investors should care as much about that.

I think Jim is right that I’m a little too interested in building things. I know I’m not interested in building deal flow, especially given how much competition there is there.

I’ve mostly enjoyed helping companies, but being an advisor seems very different from being an investor. Right?
