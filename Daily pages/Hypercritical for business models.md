# Hypercritical for business models
A hypothesis while driving:

As an advisor, my shtick is hypercritical for business models. I will fully ingest it, then critique it based on what I know, its intrinsic weaknesses, and the circumstances on the ground.

I am unsentimental about what you're doing, but I listen very closely to what you say and what it means. I will extract from you what you actually mean, then try to fit that back into what you said. The resulting fault lines tell the story without much input from me.
