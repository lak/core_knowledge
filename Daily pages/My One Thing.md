I am doing a studio because I believe it will allow me to improve at the one thing I excel at. I am good at many things, but few would allow me to be the best in the world.

A studio could do exactly that. Repetitive practice would deliver tight learning cycles and improvement spikes.

I think I can be the best in the world at creating systematic improvements to someone’s work.

I can look at a human, see their context, and find places that should be better. I can then design a product that fits into that space, pushing their effort and focus to more rewarding activities. I can figure out how to bring those products to market, in a way that best fits the user in question.

It is a complete puzzle. Few implementations will be that challenging, so it is not technology. We’re creating a new solution, so it’s not marketing. The user who benefits will be buying, so it’s not sales.

It coherently combines the right technology, the right words, and the right delivery model. It clicks.
