# Exit letter to Puppet
Subject: Thank you
Hello everyone,

Friday March 24th was my official last day as a Puppet employee, and from now on I will focus on my board responsibilities and figuring out what I’ll do separately.

Building and learning at Puppet has been the experience of a lifetime, and I want to say to everyone, both those who I’ve worked with for years and those who have just recently decided to join the party: Thank you for everything. Thank you for the trust, the belief, and the hope. Thank you for fighting through the hard times and celebrating the great times. Thank you for believing in me and in the people around you.

I am confident in the opportunity in front of Puppet the company and Puppet the technology, and I’m a huge believer in this team’s ability to do great things in this complicated, interesting market developing around us.

This address (luke@puppet.com) will work for as long as I’m a board member, and you can also always reach me at my personal address, luke@madstop.com.

With much affection,
Luke Kanies
