I don't know much at this point.  I know enough to scare me, to concern me, to make me regret, but not to decide.

I think I know why I decided as I did, but do I actually?  Is my significantly different mental state because I've released, I've mentally stepped back, because I've decided, or because something else released?  Let's summarize, but then dismiss, the reasoning for quitting.

I want to be done with this space.  I'm not actually that interested in what we're doing, in the problems we're solving, in how the markets are moving, and crucially, for us to succeed with me in charge as a product person, I do have to care, I have lead with caring, I have to show the caring, and I have to go deep.  I don't want to go deep.  I want to walk away.

I want to be a master of something.  I don't just want to be rich, or successful, or famous, I want to be one of the best people in the world at something.  I probably want to be known for being it, but I definitely want to be one.  I don't actually think I can learn to be one of the ten best people in the world at scaling a company, but I do think I could be one of the ten best product people in the world.  Part of that is desire - wow, I like product more than scaling - but part of it really is about ability.

I can feel my management style creaking.  I can feel that how I got here won't get me there, and I'm not sure I have the will or stamina to change it all, to go through the learning process necessary to get somewhere else.  I've changed so much of who I am, how I work, what I do, that I finally feel change fatigue, I finally feel like I just can't go through another revolution.

I've lost the will to make the hard decisions.  I don't want to demote Scott.  I don't want to decide on Portland vs something else.  I don't want to figure out how to hire in BD, or marketing, or sales, or operations.  I don't want to figure out if Bill is the right CFO, or if I need to fire Laura, or if I can actually work with Brian in the long term.

I am fucking tired.  I'm burnt out, I'm exhausted, I feel like I'm on the forever treadmill and I don't know how I'll ever get off if I make another big commitment.

I feel like I've lost my agency.  I don't know where to go next, so I'm letting others buffet me, instead of driving my own path.  I'm so clearly drawn to product leadership, and so clearly failing in the other areas.  I care about the ops review, and HR, and hiring, and so much more, but fuck, I just don't want to be the person who has to care about those things.

The company truly needs a huge step up in go to market.  Our problem over the next five years really is getting the market to understand and use our products, and we're not on the path to do that.

I spent more than two years building my plan based on the question, "If you started today, what would you do?"  This was painful, exhausting, and ridiculous.  It pushed me too far.  It was exactly and entirely the right thing to do.

I want my MTV.  I want my break, my time, my reward, my island, my time in the sun, my summer on a boat, my sabbatical.

I think that's all of them.

Ok.

Let's talk about privilege.

That shut you up, didn't it?

The pain of being a white male in charge of a predominantly white male company was too much.  I crashed.  The extra pain of having a PhD wife being a housewife was too much.  Privilege hurt, but what hurt even more was the limitations on my privilege.

There's a great little cartoon about a non-white helping a white into a tree, then being told by the white that to pull him into the tree would be reverse racism.  This cartoon is instructive, but wrong.

The truth is that even if that white guy wants to pull the minority, or woman, or weird person, or whatever, up the tree, he can't.  You're not personally deciding to personally fuck someone.  You're personally fighting the system.  And the system is set up to work the way it works.  If you play its game, you get rewarded, and if you don't, you just get crushed, and no one knows you got crushed because you fought the system, they just know you failed, you got run over, you didn't make it.

I got crushed because I tried to manage both.  I tried to run my company, I tried to pull people up, I tried to find a way to make a difference.  But I couldn't.  Tweeting about racism on the internet, it turns out, has in no way reduced the number of unarmed african americans our cops kill (one every 28 hours, thanks).

Ok.  So the reality of your privilege, and even worse, the reality of your inability to use your privilege to change things, made you quit?
