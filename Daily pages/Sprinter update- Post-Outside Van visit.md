# Sprinter update: Post-Outside Van visit
I am deeply afraid we bought the wrong van. I thought we would just be adding to this, so it wouldn't be that bad, but I realize now that adding is very expensive because you have to undo all of the work that's already done. Further, literally nearly everything we want to do is already done to the van we didn't buy. The only problem with it is that it doesn't have the new safety features and, to an extent, is less ideal because it's not 4x4.

I feel closer to making the decision on the seat, but at the same time, I still don't quite know how we'll do so. Time to cut some cardboard, I guess?

The seats matter most. We have to get those in place immediately. We can install a bunch of attachment points at the same time, although of course that will be super expensive ($150/ft, yay). Again, the other van already had all of this stuff. Of course it's too late now. We own this. The other one is probably already gone. The flares will probably cost $10k.

The window will probably be $4k. It definitely will be at least $2k, but... could be twice that.

$9k for a rack. Wow. Wow. It looks like we can get something from Aluminess for 1/3 that. $2500 for 100W of solar. One assumes that doesn't include the controller, or at least, not one of note.

I think we can handle the current vehicle with a bench, a fridge (which I'll probably buy tonight; tomorrow at the latest), and a solar panel. Everything else is optional. That's not true. I think we really do need the window.

We need some cardboard. Some cardboard to measure out the fridge and the two benches. We have to measure two because our goal at some point is to enable 6 people in the vehicle.
