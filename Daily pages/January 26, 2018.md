I apparently don’t know how to start writing again now that I finished the larger VC project. None of the little articles are compelling, but I don’t have another big thing ready.

Of course, a big part of the problem is I know I can’t publish yet. Yay?

I also don’t know how much of what I’ve learned, or concluded, that I should actually be sharing. Some of the hesitancy to be public is that some of my conclusions should likely be private, but I think it’s more that I assume they’re less interesting to my audience.

This whole blockchain thing is interesting. I’m very curious to see whether it turns into a real offer, and what form it takes if so. I’m surprisingly interested in it, and I think I could learn a lot, but in addition, I’m finding the idea of getting to invest further in some of my ideas around data sharing to be intriguing.

I’m definitely very interested in the whole idea of a new world of distributed software. I love the idea of Slack et al being disrupted by cheaper, better software.
