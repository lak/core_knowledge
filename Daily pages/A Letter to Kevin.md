# A Letter to Kevin

Hi Kevin,

We have built a great relationship over the last seven years. It has meant a huge amount to me, and it seems to have meant a lot to you. Unfortunately, it is now on the skids, and appears ultimately destined for deterioration.

I see little point in going over the entirety of the last six months, but I do think at least a statement of intent is necessary. It appears unlikely for a relationship to survive a crisis like I see us in without direct action.  I would like to build solid-enough footing for us to begin to talk again at least openly and ideally without acrimony, and my hope is that if we can do so, the coming years can be as fruitful as our previous seven have been.

For my part, I would like to retain and even strengthen our relationship. I have great respect and fondness for you. You have had by far the largest impact on me professionally of anyone I’ve worked with, and have been the closest thing to a mentor I’ve ever had, in any arena. I am in greater pain from the dissolution of my board relationships than I am from losing my job and all that that entails.

I did not predict how angry you appeared to be at me in our conversation after the PuppetConf keynote, so while I have my theories I do not have much confidence in them. I was entirely unprepared for our discussion, and my take-away was less the details of what you said and more that the sense of injury is mutual.

I would like to hear what makes you so disappointed me in, what surprised you so much about me, and what it would take from your perspective to make our relationship worth investing in again. I think my hearing you and why you are so upset at me is critical.

In return, though, I need some sense that you understand the source of my pain.  Relationships are built on mutual trust, and in this case, empathy is important to rebuild the trust that would be necessary for each of us to have a fulfilling relationship.

I have always known there are differences between us that we can never bridge, both personal and cultural, and there are topics that we have implicitly avoided to continue working well together. I do not expect that change, nor necessarily does it need to.

Frankly, I have always been deeply afraid of those differences resulting in a permanent rift, and each year it didn’t pleasantly surprised me. It might be that we have reached that point. But I hope not.

Instead, I would like to commit to rebuilding our relationship, and hopefully to do so on different grounds, given the different structure.

With respect,
Luke
