Ugh.

Had a conversation yesterday with Puneet, and he stands by his man. Not convinced that the high velocity model matters. Then, the main summary from the board meeting today is that the business is too reliant on enterprise field sales, management has no real visibility to other aspects, and we have to fix it.

Hopefully he walks away with some sense that I’m not the only one with that opinion, but I don’t quite know how to think about it. Certainly don’t know whether or how to talk to him about it.

If the GTM aspects weren’t enough, I then had a chat with Omri, and I walked away even less convinced. They are doing too much, and not building enough leverage in the product line. Too much duplication, too many things still being maintained even though they apparently did not accomplish their goals. We’re building a new orchestrator for cloud, because our other orchestrator won’t do the job.

Once you pass the tech stack problems, you hit all the branding issues; You need one company, not multiple, yet they’re drawing this hard line between old and new. 

I could totally understand this for the internal story, but externally? In the brand? With the products? No way.

What they’re doing right now really just has to work as an enterprise play. They don’t have any other choices. And the new products have to land, have to work. Any of that goes wrong and it all misses.
