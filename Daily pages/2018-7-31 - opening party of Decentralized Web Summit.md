Weird. I find that I used to be highly educated about how the internet happened, but I could not remember how it happened. Even weirder, I don’t know how it stopped. I mean, I know why it stopped, but it’s strange. Like a relationship I forgot about, or a house I used to live in but don’t really remember.

The people here are, in many ways, my people, but I do not know them. Or rather, I know them but they do not know me. I felt the need to educate myself, but not to join, nor to connect. Or even participate.

I had interesting conversations with two people doing database-related stuff. Both are very clearly in the frame of the Blockchain - things are built on that, not around it. They accept it as a base level of complexity, rather than trying to avoid it or fix it. They cannot understand a world where I would not want all of the things that it offers.

The weird thing is I could see a world where either of us is right. They could be shown correct, or shown crazy. But if they’re shown correct, it will create a base level of complexity that nothing else I know is built on. I mean, it’s complicated. 

Or is it less complex than it seems? Maybe I should actually build one, see how hard it really is?

Anyway. You don’t often get to directly compare world views, but I had the chance tonight to do it twice.
