# Adventure Van Design
My wife, Cindy, and I will be touring the US park system this summer with our twin 8 year old daughters (they turn 9 in August).  We have decided to build up a Sprinter Van as a roving gear/family hauler for our tour, and this document is an attempt to explain what we have figured out so far about how to do that.

This van is primarily for that tour, and there's a chance we'll sell it afterward, but success with it would result in us keeping it long-term and using it for short trips (e.g., a weekend at the coast, which we do often) and long ones (a week or two each season). We're also likely to loan it out to friends frequently, including a 6 person family with two dogs. If we can get seating together in time, we'll be taking it for a week-long trial run the last week of March, so that our first trip isn't stepping right into a 2 month journey and we can get some first-hand experience before we lock in the design.

Our goals for the summer trip are roughly:
* Spend 2 months traveling, mostly hiking, camping, and riding in the great parks, but also visiting a couple of friends in nearby cities.
* End the summer being comfortable enough camping that we could pack for it in an afternoon. Today it would probably take at least a week, possibly two, to plan for a few days in the woods, yet we fly enough that we could pack for a week-long airplane trip in an afternoon.
* Get in some great (but non-technical, mostly) trail-riding as a family. I, in particular, view bicycles as by far the best way to get around, so I hope to find places where we could turn an afternoon hike of a few miles into an afternoon ride of 3x that. I will try to get some slightly more technical riding in, but mostly it’s about long casual rides as a family.

We do not have a complete design, but we have a rough direction we want to take it, a couple of critical constraints, and a ton of ideas. As you read this, focus much more on the direction and constraints than our ideas for solving them, although realize that we’ve put a lot of thought into them.
## Constraints
The goal in laying these out is to reduce our possible solution set. There are many fantastic ideas we cannot take advantage of, and many things we love but cannot do. While we can be inspired by much, this list keeps us focused.
### Seating
This is the constraint that most of the van is organized around.

The kids need to be legally seated with shoulder belts, and the kids shouldn't have to be touching all the time when we're on the road. I.e., a two person bench wouldn't work, because they'd be shoulder to shoulder, and would fight *constantly*. 

While we will primarily be traveling as a family of 4, we would like to sometimes seat 6. The van is much more likely to be a long term investment if it can also carry my wife's parents on road trips. This is a hefty, but we believe achievable, constraint.

The kids should be able to see out the side windows in something like a normal seated position. It’s ok if they have to lean forward a little, but it can’t be impossible or too uncomfortable while seated legally.
### Existing Van
We're starting with a Sprinter 144" 4x4 van that was up-fitted by Outside, to a basic level (interior, insulation, 3 panel bed, stereo, heat, a few other things). We're going to end up undoing or working around a lot of the work already done on the van, which will be frustrating and expensive, but was the only choice once we committed to this point.  

The work we decide to do, and the order in which we do it, will be heavily affected by the van we already have, and the added cost of rework will limit our budget for other work.
### Sleeping
We need to be able to sleep 4 people in the vehicle, even though we expect to mostly camp and sometimes stay in hotels. Given the existing bed and the many doable solutions, we think this is a reasonable constraint.

Additionally, while we'd love to add pop-out flares to enable the adults to sleep sideways, their apparent cost is too high, and we are unlikely to pay it, which makes this is an important constraint.

It’s worth noting that of everything we’re giving up, this hurts the most. We’re limited on interior space, and this option creates new space in really the only way possible, so it hurts a lot to give this up. We’d love to remove this constraint. Without this feature, it isn't really the van we want.

Any bedding solutions need to be usable in both the van and in tents. We don’t want separate mattresses for sleeping in the van and in a tent, for instance.
### Bikes
This summer we have to carry two adult mountain bikes plus two kid bikes, and in future uses we'll carry 4 adult bikes. I also ride road bikes, so it should support them (mine is 6" longer than my mountain bike and doesn't have a dropper seat post so by default it's taller). Note I won't be bringing one on the summer trip unless we magically have room for a 5th bike.

Our largest mountain bike is 58” long and 34.5” tall at the saddle (lowered using a dropper seat post). Our largest road bike is 64” long and 37.5” tall at the saddle, with the seat at full height. There’s at least 6” of drop available in this seat if we’re willing to adjust the seat height at load/unload times, which we’d consider for the right trade-offs. (Again, we’re not planning on traveling with this bike this summer.)
### Kitchen
We plan to do all of our cooking outside, which means everything involved in cooking and cleaning needs to be easily accessible, and ideally portable.

Even if we wanted to cook into the van, our current constraints preclude us from having a fixed galley, toilet, or shower inside the van, and we're perfectly happy with this result.

We already own a 50qt ARB fridge (although it’s technically returnable for a fee if it’s the wrong answer), which we chose because it was the largest size that didn't block the pathway from the front seats.
### Water
We need to be able to store a lot of water, for drinking and cleaning, and we should have access to some kind of running water. It is not required to be electrically pumped, nor heated, although those would be nice.
### Power
We have relatively minimal power requirements — no microwave, no TV, no game consoles (yet). Just a fridge, some lights, and quite a few Apple devices. The fridge needs to be easy to plug in where it is stored, and the devices need to be easy to charge, both while driving and while sleeping. Assume four devices charged at once is common, and six is likely. We have not yet decided whether to bring a laptop.

We would prefer to rely entirely on solar and driving for battery charging.
### Money
We are constrained more by reason than by money. We could hire the absolute best to do absolutely everything we wanted, but doing so would have us giving up much else, and does not seem like the right investment.

With the uncertainty of our long-term ownership of the van, and our lack of experience and resulting lack of confidence in our knowledge and decisions, it doesn't make sense for us to commit too much up front.

If we were trying to minimize cost, I could do almost all of this work myself, either through fabrication or assembly, but that also doesn't make sense. I understand the value of hiring experts and freeing them to do great work, and I have generally appreciated the results.

As we encounter budget limitations, our preference is to start with low-cost experiments (such as a portable compressor rather than a fixed one for 20x the cost). If that's not an option, which we sacrifice features, then experience, then quality.
## Design Direction
This is not a solution, but it points to one. It is the rough outline of what we want, given our constraints, without any detail or commitments.

We have become convinced through our research and discussions with designers that we should develop a living-room-like experience between the bench seat and the front bucket seats. This living room space should be complemented with an awning extending from the sliding door, allowing us to have a relatively large covered space for cooking and living.

Given the existing bed, we will be storing the bikes under the bed. Given the size and number of the bikes, this means a lot of that space is devoted to bikes, and most of our storage needs to be somewhere else, and quite possibly will be portable and need to be moved when transitioning from driving/camping to sleeping.

We'd like full cabinets for the walls under the bed and high ones for the wall behind the driver, plus little cubbies and cabinets where we would otherwise have wasted space.

I want a clean, pretty electrical control and management panel.

We're going to have attachment points everywhere, so we can solve with rope what we don't have built.

We'd like both solar and a sitting surface on the roof.
## Currently Proposed Solutions
These are the best plans we can come up with based on what we know right now, but we would love nothing more than to have any and all ideas replaced with something even better.
### Seating
The desire for both a living room experience and the ability to seat 6 at some point means the kid seats need to be pushed back as far as possible, with enough room remaining to install a middle row later.

The requirement that the kids be able to see out means we have to replace the sliding T vent with a full size window. We believe but are not positive that the third row location will enable them to see out.

It also looks like one kid will have a van wall to sleep against but the other won’t, which might lead us to try to solve that in some way. Everyone’s lives will be much improved if the kids can easily sleep when they want.

We have already purchased a used stock (somewhat hideous) 3 person Mercedes bench, which we plan to install in the back.  At some point in the future, we expect to install guides for a 3rd bench, but we are not doing so today.

We’d happily give up a little living room space to get the kids closer to the front, but we haven't found a way given the need to eventually seat six, plus the lack of forward/backward motion of the benches.

We seriously considered captain’s chairs instead of the bench, but the bench gives us another sleeping location, with more flexibility and storage. This solution saves money and complexity, and should be sufficient for kids.

We would like swiveling front seats, but we are skipping them for now because of height concerns. They should also be easy to add at the last minute (or even on the tour), so we are ok holding on this for now.
### Sleeping
The adults will sleep on the existing 3 panel bed. We expect the kid's bench to sit under the third panel when driving, so to switch between driving and sleeping mode we’ll have to remove the bench headrests and install the 3rd panel.

If we were starting from scratch, we would unquestionably build out flares so the adults could sleep sideways, which is the solution we want. Our current conclusion is that this is too expensive of a retrofit to the existing van, but we are not fully decided. There are also some concerns about retrofitting the existing bed, which is already a complete, workable, and very nice solution.

For the kids, we expect to build some simple, lightweight single-person bunks that I'll hang from the ceiling when they sleep inside. This should be relatively easy to set up (using the L track buttons and rope), we should be able to store them under our mattress on the 3 panel bed, and when they're in place they'd make for a kind of roof above the living room which would be great because my wife and I should be able to sit and read or something while the kids sleep. We're also talking about making it possible to hang curtains around the various beds to enable some visual separation for privacy when desired.
### Bikes
The existing bed is a constraint, and because of it we are focusing bike storage under the bed. In general it seems to be what nearly everyone else is doing, but it does rule out [some very nice solutions][1].

We're focusing on using sliding trays for bike storage because that allows us to maximize storage around the bikes and also easily mount them front to back. I really like the construction of the trays made by [Alaska Conversions][2], but I'd like to find a more space efficient form, preferably that enables us to have a small cabinet between or around the bikes. The Traipsing About people have [a great example][3]. The trays also need to minimize vertical height, which seems to be a problem with fork mounts.

We’re also considering a [rack-based solution][4], because of cost and simplicity, but I think our seating constraints rule this out (I expect the kid bench will be pushed back so far this won’t fit).

We'll be bringing some burly bike chains and locks with us for easy locking when the bikes aren't in the van, and more secure locking for when the van is parked for a long time.

We plan to attach a bike stand to one of the back doors. I will likely do this myself, as it seems pretty simple.
### Kitchen
We already have a 50qt ARB fridge (looks like a cooler), and we expect to keep it behind the driver’s seat, where it will be mostly out of the way, easy to charge, and usable as another seat when parked.

We expect to get an enclosed, portable kitchen, such as from TrailKitchens.com. My current plan is to lash it above the fridge, to take up the least amount of floor space.

It would be great to have water in our cooking area, but most water solutions I’ve seen have it accessible from the back. I could see an argument for either or both. I expect we'll install a waster system, but I don't yet know where exactly the tank will go, where the nozzles will go, or what attachments we'll have.
### Exterior
We expect to get an aluminum rack, with as many solar panels as we can fit behind the existing vent, and flooring in front of the vent. We'll mount a side ladder just behind the side window. A couple of cross bars will be added to make it easy to mount other items later. The rack isn't actually required (since the flooring is a bit optional), but if we do solar and an awning and decide to add the rack later, we have to redo all the work, so better to do it now

We’ll mount an awning to the rack.

Our current plan is to have Aluminess fabricate the rack, stretching their stock rack a little to accommodate 160W panels, and then add a Fiamma awning to it. (This will need to be hand-cranked, as Fiamma don’t currently have an automatic awning that attaches to a rack.) If this isn't possible, we'll step down to 100W panels.

We plan to add an electrical running board that will make easy access to the passenger seat and sliding door. We do not currently plan to add one to the driver’s seat.
### Power and Light
Other than furniture, the power system has the least complete design and the least complete plan for implementation. I am assuming that I will not be able to get someone to help me install the solar in time for our trip, in which case I'll buy a solar kit from AMSolar and install it myself. I would prefer to pay someone to do this, though. The only thing I really know is I want an MPPT controller, not PWM, given its significantly greater performance. I also need a battery monitor, but don't have a strong opinion about the solution, as long it is a good experience.

I am hoping to add 1-2 160W panels to the roof of the van, and ideally won’t need to replace the auxiliary battery. We’ve been told we definitely will need to, in which case we’ll install the new ones under the van if possible (and ideally stick a new one where the existing one is, rather than waste the space).

We plan to build the electrical panel at the top of the wall behind the driver, with all of the controls visible and in reach. There’s already a heating controller in that location, plus two light switches and a dimmer switch. At the least, we’ll need to add a solar controller and a battery monitor. I’d like to add a kill switch that shuts off the entire house battery system. I also replace all switches in this area, if possible, [with a breaker panel][5]  and hook up all the core systems and any new ones to a switch on that panel. The linked example is the best electrical panel setup I’ve seen by a country mile, and I particularly like the double duty of breaker/fuse and switch. We might promote some existing fuses to breakers. We might build the panel now and add a cabinet later, so the panel should be built with that in mind.

We currently have 2 USB ports, but I think they’re both hidden in the compartment at the top of the console. These need to be accessible when we’re driving (so we can have a phone plugged in at all times for driving directions, which sucks battery). I expect to add a couple to the front, plus some near the sleeping positions. These aren't required because I can use the 12V ports for charging.

There are currently three 12V ports, counting the cigarette lighter in the front. The one in the back is devoted to charging an ARB fridge, which we’ll need to move to the middle, as that’s where our fridge will be. Ideally this will be added to, not replace, the existing 12v port in the base of the driver’s seat. (Or even, be put in the back of the seat, which is a better location.) I would not be surprised if we end up needing another port or two.

We plan on bringing almost no AC devices; the only one we can think of at this point is a hand-held blender, which we're only bringing because we've been told it's so useful. There is also a small chance that at some point we'll buy an electric cooker, although that would mean cooking in (and smelling up) the van. Because of the low usage, we plan on buying a cheap inverter to see where and when we use it, and will replace it with a nicer one if it comes up very much.

The current lighting solution is more "glaring overhead light" than cozy lamps, and I'd like to add some warmer lights at chest and eye level to make the environment more cozy, and create some isolated light pools that can be used when the kids are sleeping.

I’m not a huge fan of the light switches in the van right now, and I’d prefer to find a better solution. I’d also like the switches for the under-bed light to be turned into an actual 3-way switch, but I expect that’s too expensive to be worth it.

The light panels under the bed will need to be moved if we make those cabinets taller, I think.

I expect to install a mobile signal booster (which must be easy to turn on and off), which I assume I'll have to install myself.

I will be traveling with two-way radios so we can hike and explore in separate parties without losing touch (it is mostly for emergencies), and I would like to find a powerful base station to mount to the van, which I could have a larger antenna.

If we end up having just too much power because we manage to get 320W of solar on the roof, and we have the time and budget, I’ll install a TV and game system for entertainment (and probably an Apple TV to stream to), but this is low priority.
### Furniture
The van currently has two cabinets under the bed. The tops are hard to open, and would be impossible to if that area were packed full. They’re tall enough that they’re in the way, but short enough that you can’t store much in them.

We hope to replace those with two cabinets that run up to or near the bed (I’m tempted to leave a small amount of room at the top for loose storage, [like this][6], for things like camp chairs). I assume we'll install a water system in here. Any cabinets need to built with the understanding that they’ll be surrounded by gear, so some cleverness might be needed to enable easy access. I have been thinking about all the tricks you can use with cabinets, like revolving cabinets, Le Mans cabinets, tall thin drawers, etc. Not sure any of them work, but I'm all about easy access.

I have considered trying to fit one or two tall narrow cabinets for storing tools and such (e.g., strapped to pegboard or something), but I doubt I have the horizontal space.

I would really love to build a wide, short (e.g., 3” or so) drawer under the bike trays, but I don’t think we have the vertical space for it. I think it depends on whether we’re willing to drop road bike seat posts for load/unload. (This is only worth doing if we also build bike trays, as we could use the same system.)

I would like to add a cabinet above the bed on the driver’s side, running from the front all the way to the back. Ideally this would have some [clever design aspects][7] to make it unlikely for us to hit our heads in the living room area. I am skeptical I can get this built in time for our tour.  To keep headroom clear, I expect to use [mesh on the other side][8], and I'll do the same on both sides if we can't get something built in time.

I want a table that sits in front of the bench, and slides down to sit on the wall under the driver’s-side window when in motion. The table should be built like a [cockpit table][9], but instead of folding down, it should lift up and then slide vertically down (like many airline trays do). When in this removed position, it should have cup holders extending from it on a small shelf (with, ideally, USB ports). When deployed, it will likely need a supporting leg.

I’d like to experiment with building small cabinets on the back doors, but I’ve never seen it done, and it’s pretty low priority. We’re likely to replace the existing mesh bags because the bed interferes with the bottom one and the top one seems less useful than, say, a hanging shoe rack, in terms of convenience and total storage amount.

We'd like to install a headliner shelf, but it's relatively low priority, and we have been convinced by Outside that the common solutions do not take into account the airbags, which is obviously a problem.
### Other
We expect to buy a portable compressor, as a cheap experiment to see how much we really use it. If we use it a ton, we’ll later replace it with a built-in version.

We plan to attach L track or L attachment points pretty much everywhere we can, and then hang or attach random stuff to it. My current plan has 20’ of track in 5 locations and about 26 attachment points. I have uses for many of them, but some are just there in case I come up with a use.

We expect to have a ton of bags, backpacks, and other items stashed, hung, and attached in different places. We’ll use those attachment points, but we don’t have a specific plan. Probably our biggest unsolved problem is shoes.

We'll have some collapsible chairs and maybe a table or two for sitting outside, and sometimes on the roof (that's my favorite thing about the roof rack).

We plan to install mosquito netting at the sliding and back doors, to enable us to get fresh air without being attacked by bugs. We will be driving through vicious mosquito country.

We currently have no plan for a locking cabinet of any kind, which we should have. It should be able to store a laptop, four iPads, and our passports. If we’re able to build a short drawer under the bike drawers, and it were lockable, it would likely work for this. A secret lockable area would be even better.

There are other things we're interested in but unlikely to get, like a CB radio (doesn't seem as useful these days), forward and backward cameras to record while driving, and a built in radar detector.
# Conclusion
Hopefully this document has conveyed what we care about most, what our limitations are, and what we've been thinking about.

My hope also, though, is that it shows we've thought deeply about this, and educated ourselves about what the options are and how they fit together. In solving this kind of design decision in the past, one of the harder challenges has been level-setting with each other, and my hope is this will help that happen faster.

If you'd like to see the details of ideas we've trawled through to come to this state, follow the links below. Note that these are all about ideation, with little to no tuning or editing. Ideas added, but not removed.
