# Depression?
I took a massive psychological hit yesterday, one I could not entirely trace.

Part of it was a stupid interaction on twitter. Deleted it from my phone again, but that only goes so far. It defeats the point, rather than the problem.

It’s more than that. I really am afraid. Depressed. Lacking in enthusiasm or energy. Will. Noncommittal.

The closer I get to something, the less I want to do it. The more education I acquire, the less I want.

Even writing lacks solace.

Why do I not feel free?

Is it the arrival of expectation? Now that I’m telling people, I’m beginning to make decisions on their input, rather than my conviction. Is that the problem? 

Or is it preciousness? The mere desire to keep it mine, for as long as possible? Does the presence of someone else sully my decisions? My desires?

It does all seem too complicated, like a roundabout mechanism to do what I want.

If no one else was involved, what would I do? If I did not need money, what would I do?

Does that provide a more free answer? Or is that just a cop-out, a dodge?

I clench every time I think of hiring someone, of partnering, of building a team.

Is it just that? Fear and scarring from the feeling of failure? That I’m willing to fail again, but not in that particular way?
