The clearest sign is that I’m not funny when I write.

None of my humor comes through.

I’m writing dire polemics, rather than something humorous and informative.

Why?

At least part of it, certainly, is that I’m mentally in this pedagogical mode: I want to teach, so I have to be *serious*. Or something.

Certainly part is that my humor is dry, hard to reveal when spoken and nearly invisible when written.

But that can’t be enough, can it?

I’m writing wrongly.
