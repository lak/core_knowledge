# 2021.03.16 - a better day
The morning was spent in a therapy appointment. I came away pretty confident that Shannon can help, and especially so that I'd rather work with her than the functional neurologist.

1:1 with Jason, then a long conversation with him and Sandy resolving one of our first design issues. It was an interesting and largely rewarding discussion. We haven't had to do a lot of problem solving. It was nice to flex that muscle, and see it all get worked through.

Then a planning meeting. Heidi is running them now. It worked out pretty well. It still needs to evolve.

A short nap, then a two hour block of onboarding Hong Quan, financials meeting with Rene√©, and then advice conversation with Puneet and then Steve Herrod.

It was the kind of day I want to have. All good conversations, a wide variety, plenty of leadership, working muscles I'm good at.

The investors were just much better conversations. I focused less on my pitch, and more on just convincing them. Much less big picture, much more use cases.

So that's the story.

I've also accepted that we really are just building a CRM app. Not for networking, though -- for doing work. "Democratizing CRM" or some such.
