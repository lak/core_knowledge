You forgot about abstraction.

What if this whole model of finding opportunities is just one theme, and another is places where abstraction works?

Or places where there’s a compression opportunity?

Why do I even need a theme? Could all of this work without one? What if I had to tell that story — hey, I’m making a studio, because I have a lot of ideas and I’m confident I can figure it out.

What’s so wrong about that?
