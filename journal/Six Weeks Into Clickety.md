It’s interesting reading my questions and thoughts over the last few months. At some point the uncertainty collapsed.

Even unemployed, somehow a couple of weeks off at Xmas enabled some breakthroughs. I can’t forget: Time off will always matter. Growth requires space.

Anyway. I came away from the holidays with a few conclusions:

I wasn’t going to succeed at raising money for a fund or a studio. At least, not on a timescale that made it worth it to me.

The crypto dB is absolutely going to exist, and probably not that far from now. 

I can’t imagine building anything without it.

I can’t adopt any software that’s not built on it. (This, unfortunately, is not actually true, because it would mean I could not adopt anything at all.)

I know enough about relationship management to believe I can build something powerful, useful, and good, and I want to build it.

That’s enough. So, after a few months of dithering, I finally started it.

It’s certainly been a learning experience. 

I apparently have nothing to say about it.

It’s been fascinating learning to have a colleague again.

I still don’t know if Lizzi should be a cofounder or employee.

It’s fascinating to once again run into the “how I want to work” and “how everyone else wants to work” conflict.

So much happens in my own brain that I could never do with someone else.

It’s inconceivable to me that I could ever find a true collaborator.
  
I just watched “The Dawn Wall,” and loved it. Seeing them suffer and persevere was just amazing. Seeing Tommy not want to finish alone was pitiful, but also inspirational. I’ve been thinking recently that the stories that inspire me are centered around intensity, and wow, that’s what this story is. It seems pretty clear that Tommy only has climbing, only is climbing. I don’t want that level of single mindedness, but I am right there in being willing and able to slough off what’s necessary to be that intense.

My body is not up to it. I was never going to be an athlete, to succeed through physical exertion.

But there are spaces where I can be special.
