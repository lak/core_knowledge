I’ve given up on the status quo in my marriage.

I will no longer go to bed with the stress and uncertainty of my sex life. Which, based on the last twenty years, means I no longer have a sex life. But I’ve reached the point where the uncertainty and stress wasn’t worth it, to either one of us from what I could tell.

We no longer have positive events, close events, to hang our hats on.

We can’t leave the house. We can’t have evenings of intimacy, of joy in each other’s company, or even just distraction. Unrelenting, like it was when the kids were young.

The epidemic is not the problem. Our relationship is the problem. But the epidemic refuses to let us hide.

There is no original sin. There is no one problem, that if only we fixed it, we would be fine.

But there is a knot hole. All solution must fit through it. And it has so far prevented anything from showing up.

That knot hole is our inability to talk about anything important. We cannot negotiate. We cannot discuss. We cannot work through issues.

It is impossible. 

I can’t tell any more if it’s kabuki, if it’s emotion, or of it’s what it looks like: We just have no idea how to handle each other’s complexity.
