# Exit Letter to Charlotte
Dear Charlotte,

We can choose this time of transition, of closure, to be sad, but that does our work a disservice. Our mutual accomplishments deserve joy and gratitude, and I intend to see them that way.

One of the great privileges of my life has been working with you, building a partnership with you. The joy and confidence that you consistently showed upon seeing me gave me the belief in myself I so crucially needed. You have been the platform of so much of my success since we started working together.

You are amazing in many ways, but your ability to infect people with a positive attitude stands out. In your worst mood, people will have a better day because of a conversation with you. On your best day, your energy is a super power that leaves a glow for days. There were many days where your presence was the difference between despair and showing up again in battle dress.

You were also always my ears on the ground. I made better decisions more quickly because I knew I could trust your information.

I have enjoyed working with you. I am proud to have worked with you. My entire time at Puppet will forever be colored by how much better you made the experience for me and everyone else.

Thank you.
