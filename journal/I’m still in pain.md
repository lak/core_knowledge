# I’m still in pain
I am mostly done with the grieving process of leaving Puppet, and especially with how I left Puppet, but there’s no question I’m still in pain.

Being at the kickoff two days ago caused it all over again. Weirdly, it often swung between pain that some other guy is in the saddle but he’s just following the tracks I laid out, and pride that he’s still following my plan. Or pain that some other guy  is in there changing the business, and overall comfort that it’s not my job to be in there dealing with things.

But no matter the mood swings, I’m still in pain. Puppet was not my baby. I will be fine without it. We still need each other to some extent, but both of us should be able to survive without each other. I’m frankly ecstatic not to be tied down any more, to have a first real sense of freedom in more than a decade, and I’m excited to see what I can do with that freedom. It’s not the lack of attachment that hurts.

No small part of what hurts is the lie. The two lies.

The lie that I chose to do this.

And the lie that I approve of this CEO.

Is that all, though? Where is the pain, really?

There is clearly some amount of pain resulting from the state I left the company in. I know it’s at least partially my fault.

Certainly some part of the hurt is that I was cut off very quickly. Or at least, that was my perception. I didn’t want to step on Sanjay’s toes, but we’re on the total other end of that, and every opportunity I gave him to pull me in a little, he rejected. Am I really that easily cut out, that unnecessary? I guess everyone wants to feel needed by leadership, not just by the rank and file.
