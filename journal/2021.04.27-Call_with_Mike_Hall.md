# Call with Mike Hall
Just a short summary, since our call was 3.5 hours (!) and there’s no way to summarize it all.

The main take-away is just, we should talk more often. And I should try to get more tactical about what I’m doing and whether Heidi can deliver what I need without my doing those things.

Also, he’d be a great hire doing whatever leadership stuff. He’s not in a hurry to leave, but also excited about joining a smaller place.

At some point he described himself as “ADH’.
