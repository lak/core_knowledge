# {{date}} - Changing funding strategy
I’ve got about 50 ‘no’s from [[VC]]s for [[Clickety]]. Two more today. I’m down to just people I’d cold call. I’ve got more than a hundred of them, so I could definitely try. But I’m not sure it’s worth it.

It’s time to change.

If my only choice were to keep on or stop, it might be reasonable to keep on. But I think I can raise a million or two, get another year or two of runway, and just focus on getting the numbers where they need to be.

I think I need to let Heidi go. She’s doing a bunch of work I definitely don’t want to do, but I’m not sure that work is worth what I’m paying her.  I honestly don’t know how much she’s doing, or how I’ll make it without her. But, well, you do what you have to do. I’ll probably end up hiring some kind of help from someone. Just not an FTE, and not someone as experienced/expensive as she is.

It doesn’t help that I haven’t really gotten the operational help out of her that I was hoping to get. She hasn’t turned “I’m a great project manager” into “the company is run well”. I guess I don’t really know what being a project manager looks like. Just “write down lists of tasks, and make sure they get done”? Could be. We’re definitely not running a tight ship on the dev side. And to the extent we have a process, it’s one I’ve designed, and I’m running.

I’m super tempted to just walk away. Go back to advising. Stop trying to build this company.

I’m also tempted to let the whole team go, and try it myself. That would be crazy disruptive, and probably fail. It would be slow. I’d have to do a bunch of stuff I don’t necessarily want to do. But, well, it would be an adventure, and I’d be doing stuff I enjoy more. I’m clearly not cut out to make Heap do what I want it to do.

I need to change my involvement in product development, but to what? I don’t know.

I need to get back to [[Writing]].

I need to do more [[Advising]].

I can’t do it all.

The most obvious things are:
- The current thing is just not working. Not fast enough. Not good enough.
- I need more direct engagement in the product learning loop. I don’t have to be writing code. But I probably should be, in some form or another.


My plan is something like:
1. Get some feedback on the fundraising change. I talk to Kenny today, and Karin tomorrow. I’ll work to talk to Geoff and Julianne this week. And probably Aviel. I think that’s enough.
2. Take a full week off for the ND travels.
3. Finalize what the post-change team will look like, and make plans for how to get there. I almost assuredly have to tell Heidi — and the rest of the team — before the strategic seclusion.
