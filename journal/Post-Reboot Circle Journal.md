# Post-Reboot Circle Journal
This circle has helped me understand just how much I worked through in the six months around the transition. By the time I joined this circle, I was nowhere near as raw or as upset as the rest of the group. If anything, I had become somewhat complacent.

What worked for me, or challenged me? Not much.

What are you taking forward? The need for community.

What support do I need, if any, going forward?
