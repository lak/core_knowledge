# Remembering
When I was 13, I remembered my childhood.

Not all at once. It was slow enough that I didn't even realize it had been missing. And it never did come back all the way. But at some point, I noticed the glaring gaps, acknowledged that maybe it wasn't normal to have only a few memories as a kid.

When I was 8 years old, I cut a foot of hair off my head and began attending public school in Nashville, TN as a vegetarian who’d never heard of God. For those who don’t know the American South, this meant things like other third graders explaining matter-of-factly that I was going to burn in hell forever because I hadn’t been dunked in this special water by this special guy at a special ritual.

Now, I don’t care if you’re a devout theist, a pagan, or an atheist like me; it’s too much to expect an eight year old to make sense of this.

I am the fifth of six kids, and everyone in my family handled this transition differently, largely influenced by their ages when it happened. I can’t imagine the pain my sisters went through being in high school — which is already pretty much the worst thing in the world — when we moved. I have never talked to any of them about it, because it’s too painful. It’s been more than three decades, and I just can’t imagine that conversation. So I don’t know how they dealt with it.

I do know that how I dealt with it was to try to take in all of the information provided to me — my own experiences, any conclusions I could reach logically, and what everyone was telling me — and get it to make some sort of coherent sense.  It was absolutely impossible do include everything into a single coherent whole, so the only viable option was to remove everything until it worked, then add back anything that didn’t break it. 

I didn’t realize it at the time, but apparently this process of removal wasn’t just cutting away beliefs, it also cut away the experiences that led to those beliefs. It should not be surprising that I could no longer believe in my own peace, since I could not remember experiencing it. It’s fair to describe me today as a stoic, in that I am generally not emotionally attached to my own outcomes. I mean, I want to win, to do well, to succeed, but I also know that it’s the trying, it’s the pushing, not the winning. I am incredibly confident that this stoicism is the foundation for a lot of my success, and it is founded in my rebuilding my psyche intentionally, when provided conflicting information.

If I’m unemotional enough to strip away my childhood, why should I not be willing to sacrifice much less important emotions?
