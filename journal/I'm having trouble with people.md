When I look at my task list, the biggest problem is the people. They don’t belong, there or anywhere else.

They don’t belong in task lists, because it is lacking the connections and tools I need.

But they don’t belong elsewhere, either. I’m not trying to close deals, so a CRM does not make sense. I’m not just trying to “connect” with them, so LinkedIn fails.

I want an app that does both contact management and project management — that is, it manages contacts, but imports within it the idea of goals and intents.

This reminds me of one of my early research results: that I want to do my work where it lives. Referencing the work in Trello is not enough. Task management fails because it is somewhere else. You need something that can provide all of the management tools without duplicating things, without being separate.
