# Summarizing the Test-Fit Weekend in the Van
We just spent a long weekend at Rockaway Beach on the coast of Oregon. It was our our last realistic opportunity to test our converted Sprinter van as our mobile operating base for the two months of exploration we plan this summer.

The primary additions to the van since our trip down the coast over Spring Break were our beds — enabling all four of us to sleep in the van — and cabinets attached to the upper part of the van, behind the driver. These changes, plus the fact that our plan had us spending three nights in a single location, sleeping in our van for all of them, made for a very different experience than last time. We had to cook and clean up all of our meals, and use the public restrooms for toilets, showering, and brushing teeth.

Thus, while our Spring Break trip was a good test for the experience of staying in hotels and frequently shifting location, this was a good test of what it will be like to camp from this van. Between the two trips, we covered the majority of what our travel will be like. The major gaps come in transition — we never had to camp multiple nights in a row in different sites, so we have little real sense of the setup/tear down costs, other than that they’re real and not terribly pleasant, but already better than they were for our first trip.

What did we learn?

## Cabinets

The cabinets help much more than you’d expect from such a small amount of space. We organized it this time with one cabinet for me, one for Cindy and the girls, and one for miscellaneous. The last cabinet was also the most accessible, and its purpose shifted over the three days.

After discussions with Cindy toward the end of the trip, we largely concluded it was smart to put clothes in the cabinets, but we needed to move everything else out. We need to organize the van by access rate more than anything else, and also by function rather than ownership. That means clothes can be hard to reach (which the cabinets above the bed are), because we only really change clothes once a day (usually), but we can’t put our toothbrushes there because we have at least two and often fix tooth brush uses a day (adults and kids tend to brush separately, and adults often separate).

This led us to conclude that we have more room to optimize storage. The major remaining blank canvas in the van is the vertical stretch of wall between the adult bed and the sliding door. We plan to build some sort of storage system there, from either canvas pouches or maybe a wooden cabinet. Either one should include multiple means of attaching our many small bags and pouches, hopefully in both a locked-down travel mode and also an easy-access parked mode.

Beyond the existing cabinets, we’re planning on building cabinets under the bed, and our experience this weekend has definitely shifted our conception of the ideal answer.

We hated having the water supply be via the back of the van. It was frustrating to have to open every door to cook (the water tank was behind the secondary door, so the primary rear door also had to be opened), and of course it makes little sense to have the water so far from the kitchen. It would be ideal to have running water run to the side of the van, rather than the back.

It was useful to have a lot of wall room in the back to secure large objects like tables and chairs. Even when we no longer have to secure the water tank toward the back, we’ll still have these large objects, which has caused us to question the wisdom of building full cabinets that go all the way to the back of the van. We are leaning instead to having no cabinet behind the driver’s side, or possibly a minimal one just over the wheel well, and then shorten the passenger-side cabinet to leave attachment space in the back.

We also got benefit from attaching items directly to the underside of the bed. It’s unclear how much space will remain once we have the trays in place, but it’s worth keeping this in mind.

## Beds
The adult bed, now perpendicular to the van using flares, is largely a success. We were both able to sleep, and, it seems, relatively well. The primary remaining question is whether to use the inflatable mattress we already have, or to have Outside build one for us. Either seems sufficient, neither seems perfect. The big upside of using the inflatable is ease of transition between tent and van, since we should be able to just slip the bag and mattress from one to the other (although this is likely to be far more annoying than this phrase implies). I tend towards just sticking with the inflatable mattress we have, even given it barely fits in either the bed frame or in our sleeping bag.

We brought our (new) pillows from home. I think it’s correct to use normal pillows on this trip, but it seems we should purchase much smaller ones specifically for this trip, rather than trying to use our king-size pillows on our full size bed. More than half of my pillow hung off of the mattress each night.

The kid beds were the only aspect of the work that we fabricated ourselves, and they were largely a success. Hanging them apart from each other, with one in the cab and one behind the driver’s seat, helped a lot. It allowed us to use most of the space even while the beds were hung, and gave additional hang-out space for the kids to spend time. The amount of time they spent there made it clear how beneficial they would find it to have curtains strung over their beds, enabling them to have some privacy. Similarly, Cindy’s idea of stringing a curtain across the adult bed is also clearly good. There will be precious few opportunities for privacy, and enabling the beds to provide some will make a big difference.

There are a couple aspects of the kid beds that could use work.

There is a mattress stuffed inside the PVC frame, and held in place by the thin rope that stretches the canvas. Thus, they are able to easily push against the rope, and are likely a bit more decorative than we might like. I’d prefer to find some means of supporting the mattress better, either through using a wider support (e.g., webbing instead of a rope) or through adding some kind of platform (a long plastic sheet?).

The second problem is that the ends of the PVC are rubbing against the van in a damaging way. Based on a small amount of research, we should be able to replace the T joint currently used with an elbow joint that would provide a smooth edge in all directions except upward, which would be fine. It would also make the beds slightly smaller, which would be great. The only apparent downside is that the beds will not stack as well, which seems a worthwhile compromise. They might also present the children with a few more head bonks, which is less of a great answer. 

## Other minor changes

We added shoe holders to the back doors, and these were largely a success. We are unlikely to use all of them, but they cover the essentially useless upper pockets, and make the lower pockets more useful by providing some separation above and within them. They’re also secure enough while providing a ton of choices. There were so many, there was little need for order or consistency.

The new lights worked well all around. The reading lights were used often, were easy to put away, and were generally in the right locations. The ambient lights in the flares were good, albeit a bit white for ambience. The loading lights were unneeded this trip, but I can see they will provide value.

The additional switches, with labels, were nice. It was great that everyone was able to understand the switches. The two way radio seems more like an experiment than something we’ll really get utility from, but we’ll see. This wasn’t a typical use case, in multiple senses.

The addition of a bungie net above the visors is somewhat clever, but doesn’t really solve the question of how best to use that space.

## Other lessons

The awning will be much appreciated when it arrives. We relied heavily on our tarp, and would likely be wise to bring a second, larger one.

We still have no camera storage solution, and likely should.

We should bring a short length of garden hose, mostly to facilitate filling our water tank but it will likely find other uses.

We are spending a lot of money and effort on the bikes but will likely not get nearly the utility out of them that that effort implies. I do hope we’re able to spend a lot of time on the bike, but I am somewhat skeptical.

The rug outside the sliding door was a great idea, and the specific rug was nicely chosen.

We don’t love any of our chairs, and especially dislike the gray chairs because of their stupid cup holders.

Our coffee solution is insufficient. The Aeropress is just not efficient enough to make coffee for two while also cooking breakfast, and preparing a meal can’t be a two person job. Cold brew coffee might be exactly what we should do all the time, but we might be wise to be sure to have a good pour-over solution, too. A french press might suffice, as it uses the same grind as cold brew.

There is plenty of room to optimize the dishes and kitchen organization. We need to support multiple states (kitchen deployed or not; in the van or away; in a hotel), and right now it’s organized to be pretty fixed in structure.

It’s worth investing in fire starting being easy. The nice, expensive matches were utterly brilliant because they burned hot for much longer, and provided more wood in the handle to help light the fire. We need a long-reach lighter for the stove. Normal matches and lighters were annoying, and an unnecessary compromise.

# Conclusion

I consider this weekend a success. There were shortcomings and limitations, but we learned a lot, and we successfully spent three days living out of the van without huge gaps. There’s a difference between three days and sixty three, but based on this weekend, I believe both that we can do the trip, and that we have done a good job of getting the van and our equipment into sufficient shape that the trip should hold no fear from a gear perspective.
