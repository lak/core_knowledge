The Studio is the right thing to do. It makes sense, it’s a good idea, and much of the work would be compelling and interesting.

But I’m not excited by it.

Part of that is just that I know the first work is not the interesting stuff — I’m creating LLCs, hiring, and fundraising, instead of going out and meeting with prospective users and founders.

Part of it, though, is that I can tell I’m doing this because it’s a good idea, rather than because I want to do it. Hell, I’m more excited by the naming and branding than I am by the idea.

Part of it is also that it seems kind of douchey to be running a studio. Not as much as to be running a fund, but at least with a fund you’re not semi-retired and just having fun, which is a real risk with a studio.

Is this lack of excitement important? Is it real?

Was I excited about Puppet when I started it?

Not really. Eventually I became fully engaged, but I remember the month or two it took me to really get going: I was not thrilled. Not even committed.

At least then I knew what I needed to do. The template was in place: Make mailing lists, an irc channel, and start writing code.

There’s greater uncertainty here, but most importantly, there’s less drive to the fun stuff.

Direct community building, coding, product building, problem solving. These all come, but not at first.

Of course, with Puppet, I don’t remember the customer engagement. Some of it I did not need to do because I did the work myself, but some of it I just did over the years, watching the people I worked with, going to conferences, and everything else.
