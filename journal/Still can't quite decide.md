I‘m planning to pitch the studio to a couple of investors this week, yet I can’t really decide.

Do I found:
* The Studio
* A crypto db thing
* The three way task mgmt thing

(Talking to Aneel)

The studio is kind of three vectors:
* large pools of specialized users
* doing the work out in the world
* building companies for non-generic use cases

It might just be that I’m not ready to switch away from focusing on one company.


The larger the disconnect between your belief in your super geniusness and your willingness to do the hard work, the more the opportunity is.
