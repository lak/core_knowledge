# Notes on Clickety's future
# [[Kenny Van Zant]]
I talked to him yesterday. He mostly thinks I should stop. He heard a lot of suffering, and doesn't think I should have to go through it. Certainly, it's not worth suffering to make investors whole.

This was a very freeing conversation. He talked a lot about [[freedom]] explicitly, including one memorable quote:

	Money buys freedom.
	
It's taken me a long time to realize that.

I walked away from that being pretty sure I was going to walk away from Clickety, but most importantly, feeling like I was allowed to.

# [[Julianne Brands]]
My conversation with Julianne was more of a classic investor meeting. She wasn't exactly trying to get me to make investors whole. But she at least pushed me to think about finding a place to acquire the company so the investors got their money back, or some equivalent thereof. 

# [[Karin]]
She noted:

	You process through suffering.

She had a lot of comments on what I enjoy, and what I don't.

Her final summary was:

	It sounds like you should keep going
	
Just based largely on what I find interesting, what my learning edge is, things like that.

Lots to think about.
