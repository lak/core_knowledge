2016 Coaching Outcomes

•	I am able to coach my executives on the areas I care most about in the business (particularly on design-like decisions about how we should work) and I observe my execs effectively acting on the coaching
•	My execs and I perceive my opinions and coaching toward executing them as a significant factor in our success and rarely as a drag on performance or morale
•	Those that report directly to me report a greater sense of satisfaction with their interactions with me and they value and seek my input to help identify and drive change
•	I am able to effectively build with my executive team a shared future of the company I want to create, and they buy into how I want us to get there
