Karin coaching notes, 8/26/16

When looking at exec hiring: 
- Skills 
- Culture fit 
- Relationship dynamics with me 

New term: Cathexis: the process of investment of mental or emotional energy in a person, object, or idea 

Somehow related to internal neurobiology. Thinking also of biological responses, from the teamwork podcast thing.

It appears I've never fired someone for reasons of cultural fit or relationship dynamics, and always wait for performance to be the problem. Thus: I give insufficient weight to those areas. 

"Should I staff my team entirely with people I have an efficient, effective relationship with? Do I deserve to?" 

From the perspective of what's best for the company, is it better that I accept only people who fit in all 3 ways, and quickly reject those who don't, or is it better to invest in the gap areas? 

A big part of this is just access to people. 

[]()Revisit my definition of culture fit. I am correct that it's not about wearing the same kind of shoes, but I am incorrect about what I'm allowing as a result. E.g., ease of direct communication with me, being a reader, being a writer, being comfortable with long-form writing.
