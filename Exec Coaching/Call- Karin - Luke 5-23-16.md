Call: Karin / Luke 5/23/16

Karin says, when asking 'why', find a way to show some warmth, and some empathy. When do you do this well, and when do you fail at it? 

Am I too impeccable? Would my team say I was? Is that a better way of saying I care about the 'how'? 

From Nathan: 

Luke is a compiler - if any statement is invalid, the whole thing falls apart. 

From me: Systems thinker who has to build a whole system that works for any of it to make any sense at all. Nothing is useful until I have the whole thing.
