# Karin 8/5/16 - Luke’s values

Balancing optimal, defensible, and unsentimental/unattached/not precious

My leadership values:
* Service to the team
* Buidling and sustaining (diverse team, w/women & minorities), against the trends
* Listening first
* Continuous improvement

Whatever beliefs you have should be optimal, you should be able to defend them to anyone w/out offense or emotion, and should discard them w/out sentiment once they become non-optimal.

Because I struggle to shift between planning and execution, I often have unintended consequences on people, e.g., they over-optimize for areas I don’t think are as relevant

Inentionality of effect. Did you, in this conversation, have the effect you intended on the people around you?
