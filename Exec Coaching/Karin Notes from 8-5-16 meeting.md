Karin Notes from 8/5/16 meeting

Luke Kanies 
8-5-16 
  
\1. Service to the Team // Servant Leader  

Anti-elitism / Equality 
I am not special; uncomfortable with special 
  
\1. Treat all people as people  

Diversity, respect 
  
\1. Process / How  

What I consistently care about 
High quality additions I can make 
Special skill 
Intentionality is part of it 
Closest to a moral view of universe 
(note to Luke—3 and 4 might need to be merged, not sure.  You will know. ) 
\1. All positions need to be defensible  

Need to take a position and not let it happen to you 
Can’t afford to be purely responsive 
Information available to help you choose 
Ask the most efficient questions: Which are the most scary/dangerous question you can ask of your hypothesis 
Optimal 
  
  
  
                                    
Defensible                                 Unattached or unsentimental 
  
Whatever belief and plans you have you should be able to defend those plans w/out taking offense, without getting upset 
Be willing to discard any plans once they become non-optimal 
Allow your ideas to become irrelevant 
  
\1. Listening  

Listening to understand before responding 
  
\1. Relentless improver  

I approach all conversations as if it is a top priority 
My assumptions about context is that it is in the range of relevant, i.e. high priority 
Then we would be trying to optimize it 
Actions:
1. Distill (K2 àhelp distill) into communication that others can understand 
2. Revisit op manual 
3. Sit down with Sanjay to see if we can align on some key leadership values and perspectives.
