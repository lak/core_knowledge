- Our [[Strategic Seclusion]] ended today.
    - Today we went through my [[Clickety Quarterly Strategic Snapshot]]
        - It was effective. It was a good substrate for talking about stuff, and generally, didn't leave much important out.
        - I definitely want to get in the habit of writing these. That's going to require time to think, and time to write.
    - The overall event was a success. People weren't too fatigued, everyone stayed bright eyed and bushy tailed, and we got a lot of work done.
    - I would prefer days that I can devote entirely to strategy, rather than this mixture where a couple of hours are on strategy but the rest is just a normal day.
- It was my third [[Workout]] using heavier weights. I definitely went too long with the light weights. And the heavier ones definitely require a different response from me. I need to snack, drink water, etc. It was also at least my second meeting this week where I rushed to a meeting after the workout, pink and sweating. I need to start on time, so I have at least fifteen minutes to cool down. The full workout + changes and such takes about 45 minutes.
- I ordered myself an [[XDR Display]] this week. I remembered at the last minute I need a new graphics card to run it from my mini, so I ordered that today, too. I'm excited to try it, if a bit trepidatious. It's huge, expensive, not a tough screen, I actually want it down where my photos are, etc.
- My brain is fried. I'm sure I did a bunch of other stuff, but I mostly don't remember it.
- I experimented a bit with Obsidian. I like nearly everything about it. Probably my only real complaint is there's no web site and no mobile app, so I can't use it on my ipad. That's not lethal, because I can just edit plain text. But it would be nice.
    - It's also fair to say I'm nothing like a Roam pro user, so I might be missing out on a lot.
    - I think this is a great fit for our team, though. We can get most of the benefits, without putting our data behind a paywall. Most of our text will just be plaintext and work fine, too, with no reliance on Obsidian.
- I met with [[Lauren Peate]] of [[Multitudes]], did some work with [[Kristen Gallagher]] of [[Edify]], talked to [[Ann Miura-Ko]] and [[Gordon Ritter]] about them, met with [[Leo Polovets]], talked with [[Sean Jacobson]]
