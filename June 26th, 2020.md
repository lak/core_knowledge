- This was the first week I could log into [[Clickety]]. I can't really use it yet, but it's a start. It's an immediate shift from theory into stuff I actually need, right now.
- I watched a few videos on how to use [[Roam]]. I would like to commit more to it.
- No bullet speak. I will write in complete sentences.
- I had a productive day until I took a nap. I never really recovered after. This might be because I just didn't have much to do by then.
- I worked a bit on the [[Privacy Policy]]. Can't say I made progress, though. I'd like to use Roam's, but I'm not sure if I'm allowed.
- I'm feeling overwhelmed, but don't actually have that much on my plate. It's just, what I do have I am struggling to move forward.
- I got a final version of the second post in the [[Clickety launch blog posts]]. Man, that took forever. My last edit round was nearly two hours, for a post that's under 1000 words. This is going to be harder than it looks.
- [[Fleetsmith]] (I was an [[advisor]] to them) sold this week. I should clear about $200k from that, before taxes. Going to buy myself an [[Apple]] [[XDR Display]]. :)
- I signed on as an [[advisor]] to [[Edify]] this week.
- I talked to [[Neuflect]] about being an [[advisor]]. Not sure. It's a fit for my thesis, but I'm not convinced they've thought through it all. They certainly don't have much of a plan for the money side. And their growth story is pathetic. They don't have to plan to be huge, but they shouldn't plan to take that long, at least, not if they're going to raise $2m.
- I had a meeting with [[Flybridge]], a possible [[Clickety Series A]] investor. Meh. Just an associate, so I don't really learn much. But it's nice to be courted.
- I injured My Back, pretty badly, on Saturday. It seems to be mostly healed, but not all the way. I initially injured it a bit [[Working Out]], then seemed to exacerbate it mopping the steps.
