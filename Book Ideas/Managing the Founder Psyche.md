# Managing the Founder Psyche
You’ve got to do the work, but you have to stay a person while you’re doing it

It’s not a coincidence you’re there

Remembering why you did it

Own your weird

Find the power in your weird

“Weird and loud, since 1975”

Aspirational brand values: bring the weird

Behaving this authentically causes me to operate out of phase
